To THE YOUTH of our land this little book is especially commended, with the hope that it may not only meet with a favorable reception from them as a story, but may, be to them as a quickener in draw- ing the line between right and wrong. The author has had a long business experience: which experience-while he would not here laud him- self as being better than others-has only tended to convince him that there is much in currently re- ceived, business principles, even among those- whom we call " good men," that is wrong,-and so wrong, as to be not only injurious to him upon whom, but by whom committed.      Bible teachings and principles are adapted to, business transactions, even now-though many seem to doubt it-and we were all the happier, and proba- bly more successful, would we heed what they say, and take them as a "lamp to our feet and a light to our path."     CONTENTS.

CHAPTER L IT'S a singular story,     think you will say, before having rea it through;. Singular, however, though, it may be, we hope there are none who may read it but will do so with both pleasure and profit. The BENNIE STOUT Of the story was a youth, the record of whose life, peculiarly interesting and eventful as it is, might well be accepted. as more of a study than a story: for, connectedy with, or in fact giving rise to, the very features of his history which will doubtless interest us most, there is something deeper than story, and more earnest than entertaing. ment. It will not only be the youthful reader,  ho will stop, and wonder, and probably aask met   twl  o  nyb teyuhu    edr    8     HOW BENNIE DIDD T. questions as to some of the things that are told of Bennie Stout, but the older reader also; that is, if any such do take the book in hand to read. But before reaching a point on our way from which we might not like to turn aside, it will be well that we locate the incidents 'and events narrated; after which we will the more intel- ligently and pleasantly proceed. "COURT STREET," in the good old city of Q --, United States of America, is the one which, especially among the girls and boys, goes by the name of the "Grand old street." Grand, however, as it is, with its marble and granite warehouses, banks, and other public buildings; and active as it is, with the cease- less surging and swaying of business life, it was, not hundreds of years ago, only a cow- path, giving no promise of what it was to be- come. You would laugh very much, and open your eyes some, too, with astonishment, could you   HOW BENNIE DIIDIT.      9 but listen an hour or so to the marvellous and quaint stories of life in Court street in early days; and if, you are a little fidgety about In- dian and bear stories, you might become con- siderably so at some of the tales that might be told. This, however, would soon give place to amused sensations, as you would listen to the recital of manners and customs as they then existed. Nevertheless, those were- the days to which we who are getting old take pleasure in looking back. Habits and bonnets were alike "queer," but we presume that the grandmoth- ers and maidens of those times would- have been just as much amused could they have looked ahead at us, as we can possibly be in looking back at them! So, take it altogether, we-would not fear to see the old past and the new present of Court street side by side. We have spoken of the granite and marble - buildings with which the street abounds; and it is these which have given to it its "grand" reputation. Such an array of palatial archi- tecture intermingled with the din and bustle of   10     HOW BENNIE DID IT. trade you will seldom see, and it would prob. ably strike you as a mixing up of things that by rights ought to be kept the farthest apart. But you will please remember that if the build- ings are palatial, so are the men who do busi- ness in them. You probably never knew such a, term to be applied to men before; nevertheless, it suits the present case exactly, and we hope will be accepted: for very many of the busi- ness men of Court street are not only pos- sessed of great wealth, but of great minds, with which they are enabled to devise and work the details of business to an extent that is simply stupendous. In weight, their merchan- dise is handled by the tons and shiploads, and in values, by the thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars. They are neither "bulls" nor " bears," but legitimate dealers, whose ope- rations are bona fide. And it requires, indeed, no ordinary commercial genius and energy, and courage too, to maintain the position and wield the influence and power of a Court street mer. chant.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      " But there is a special reason why these gen- tlemen should have such palaces in which to transact their business. It is not merely be- cause of their great commercial position, and the vastness of the enterprises in which they engage, but because so many of them bring to ' their business a high-toned morality and cour- tesy, such as dignifies their work, and lifts it above the "every man   for himself" policy which spurns not, but practises the "tricks of trade." There are so   many "dodges," we regret to say, in commercial life, to which some men resort, that it is refreshing to know of a community of merchants where the " dodges" are the exceptions and not the rule. Hence the propriety, as we conceive, in such men as those of ', Court street" having as it were pal- aces in which to transact their business, the men and the palaces being so well adapted to each other.  The history of BENNIE STOUT is one which we wish may have a very general reading; but . especially would we be pleased' if it could go   12     HO W BENNIE DID IT. into the hands of thousands of our youth who propose for themselves a commercial life. In, building anything, it is advantageous to do so on a good foundation; but it is unhappily the fact that too many mercantile builders lay their foundations in axioms, current and accepted though they may be, such as when brought to the touchstone of Christian principle, will be found rotten and unsafe. And that commercial college which conscientiously seeks to shape its teachings of the principles of business in accor- dance with the law of God, may enjoy the com-r forting thought that it is accomplishing a higher mission than could be possible by the most thorough "commercial course" that falls short in the feature named. What a revolution there would be on earth were business conducted according to the "law of love!"l And not only in the increase of our happiness, which, however, is the important thing, but in the actual moneyed prosperity of all. Of course the old hackneyed objection will come in just here, that no such desirable state of things can   f   MHOW BENNIE DID IT.    13 be expected in this world, earthy as we are. This, however, is threadbare. Right is not right any more in eternity than in time, and not less a duty to be performed now than here- after. The mere technicalities of human law cannot possibly set aside the obligations of divine law; and if our hearts are right towards God, will we not give evidence thereof by our- immediate effortsdo bring our business transac- tions to the standard of "doing to others as we would that they should do to us?" "Loving my neighbor as myself" is not sup- posed to mean that I shall sell my house and give him the money. Nor can it be supposed to mean, that I shall continually be dividing and sub-dividing, so that everybody shall possess alike. We think it would not take many words to prove such a procedure absurd. How it may be in heaven, we don't pretend to know; but all such reference is beyond the point at which we aim in asserting ;that " laws of business " should ever be subject to the ^-   "    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Iaw of love," and on such'a basis can be happily and prosperously conducted. Thus much by way of introduction. Please join me now, and we will turn our steps into , Court street," until, reaching No. 77, we find ourselves in front-of the commercial." palace " of Mr. BENJAMN STOUT. * The house, at first glance, strikes you strange- ly, if not favorably. You can, of course, at once decide that it is, in a businesslight, one of the strongest houses on the street; and, on entering, you see within, as without, that every- thing is activity and work. But that which might appear strange to you is this: on the marble front of the building you will see wrought a variety of commercial insignia, the devising of the proprietor's peculiar taste, and so s]ilfully executed as to produce a most pleasing effect. Much of it is illustrative of the individual history of the head of the house, exhibiting the consecutive phases thereof from his position as a boy, and advancing step by * 4   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      15 step, until he attains the topmost position. One of the first features in these chiselled illustrations is that of a boy just placing his foot on the bottom round of a ladder, with his eyes steadfastly fixed on the top, where a wreath of laurel is awaiting. A closing fea- ture is his having gained the top, where with cap in hand he is waving it in token of victory, while the laurel has taken its place, and is in graceful position on his brow. As to the- good taste, or bad, of all this, we have nothing to say. Good men, and even wise men have their peculiar ideas, and their eccentricities. And there are things which such men sometimes do, which in their minds have a purpose for good, and which doubtless do good, notwithstanding our opinions as to the propriety, or even the good taste of the course pursued. There can be no doubt, how- ever, that there can be a lesson of value, particularly to the young mind, as it may be arrested, and stands curiously studying the history thus singularly presented; for the look- I , a   16     HOW BENNIE DID IT. er-on may thus be taught, as he otherwise might not be, how he, too, by a diligent and faithful perseverance, may go from a humble to an exalted position, and enjoy it all the more from the knowledge that it was thus laboriously attained, We may say, in all this exhibition on the front of No. 77, there- is nothing, we think, that will strike you as a piece of vanity on the part of the proprietor; and, having traced it through, your eye will doubtless turn, with pleasure, to the two short words, that in plain- raised marble, under the arch of the main doorway, simply say BENJAMN STOUT. o          , .   CHAPTER II. BENNIE   STOUT, at the time we wish to introduce him to you, was about fifteen years of age. He was the son of truly gen- teel parents, who, when he was thus young, were reduced to poverty. The family circum- stances, therefore, made it necessary that he should look about and devise some means by which he might not only support himself, but aid in supporting his dependent brothers and sisters. Having been favored with as liberal an education as was consistent with his years, he had thus much of advantage. This, in addi- tion to a refined and courteous address, made for him a recommendation that was most help- ful in his time of need. Careful his\ parents had been in their efforts to implant within the \   18     HOW BENNIE DID IT. minds of their children, from earliest years, colrrect ideas as to the proprieties of life. This was in accordance with the education e which themselves had received, and they were well prepared from their own experience to testify to the advantages of such a training. It was a hard day for Bennie, in some respects, when he saw that he must go forth from the pleasant and refined home to which he had been accustomed, and where he had lot known an anxiety as to daily necessities, to rub against the rough corners of life. Stran- gers could not of course be expected much to  sympathize with him: the loving and gentle language of a cultivated home was to be exchanged for the rugged talk of trade, and the hard jingle of dollars and cents. Musical as the latter might be to many, to him it would naturally be, at first, like the discordant tuning of an unstrung fiddle, hard to be endured, though necessary as a preparation for the good to come. However, he had courage, and hope. Boy though he was, and knowing that he had  8   ROW BENNIE DID IT.     19 a battle to fight in' which there was much to overcome, hle buckled on his armor, and went into the contest like a man.  His great strength, however, lay in this: that he had Christian parents} who had taught him to pray, and to believe that GOD is a helper and a friend to those who put their trust in him, and seek his counsel and aid. ThIe young Benjamin was not long in obtain- ing a situation. Indeed he did not expect much difficulty in this respect. There were many good friends who had known him all his life, among whom was his Sabbath school teacher, fromwhom he received recommenda- tion and assistance. Indeed, before he made any special personal application for himself, the Sabbath school teacher referred to had already opened the way, and made known his scholar's case to a Mr. GEORGE WILSON, an extensive merchant and shipowner, who was doing busi"  ness on the very "Court street" with which the reader is now acquainted.  Can you make room in your houserMr.   20     HOW BENNIE DID IT. Wilson, for a little friend of mine?" asked Mr. NORTON, the Sabbath school teacher. "Well," replied Mr. Wilson, cheerfully, "I presume we can 'make room,' as you say; but I do n't know at present of any particular need that we have for him." "True," said Mr. Norton, "to take but a glance of your army of clerks and other em- ployees, evenf"bn the floor where we now are, one would think that every department was filled: nevertheless, it is the case very often that such a house as yours is one which can generally find occupation for employees almost without limit; and in addition to this I am. specially anxious that t]his boy should have a place with you." Mr. Norton meant a good deal in, the empha- sis which he put on the two words. The gen- tlemen were firm friends, and had long beeil so, although in different occupations, Mr. Nor- ton being a lawyer, and although Mr. Wilson was not a professor of religion, and' rather looked with a doubting eye on the devotion of 9,  .             .   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     21 his friend to the Sabbath school work. It was because of Mr. Wilson's skeptical views in this respect that Mr. Norton was anxious that Ben- jamin should enter his employ; for the faithful Sabbath school worker's experience had long ago taught him that children were often more successful and efficient preachers than the pul- pit occupant himself. He knew that there is a sort of pulpit hardening which seems to grow upon some, even who are regularly in the sanc- tuary, that is often only broken up by some outside providence which compels the callous listener to see the beauty of religion, and to feel the necessity there is for the Saviour. So he considered the present a most happy opportun- ity for doing good both to the boy and the man. Mr. Wilson, too, was quick to catch the idea, when his friend spoke as he did. He said nothing, however, but determined quietly, and sensibly to use the present case as an illustra- tion for the benefit of either his own or his friend's Sabbath school views, as the result might be. It was a happy thing for him that   HOW BENNIE DID IT. although apparently unmovable under the most powerful preaching,lhe was nevertheless suffi- ciently restless in the privacy of his own thoughts to feel that there was as yet a want of something which he had not attained. And while he was too proud to confess this, he at the same time continually hoped that some agency would do the work for him that others professed had been done for them. "Who is the boy ?" asked Mr. Wilson, with a significant smile, " one of your Sunday school scholars, of course ?" "His name is BENJAMIN STOUT, and he is one of my Sunday school scholars." "STOUT I" exclaimed Mr. Wilson, with con- siderable surprise.  Can it be that he is a son of,the former merchant of Centre street ?" "The very same," was the reply. "A man, who, if I am -correctly informed, made rather a disreputable failure " said Mr. Wilson. "The very reverse is the fact," answered Mr. Norton, quickly; "it was one of those clear    23   I1O 1i BENNIE DID IT.   cases where, through the imprudence of the line of business connection'which he had, the crash carried so many with it that Mr. Stout was compelled to go." "I am glad to hear you say so. And were his exhibits of his affairs entirely satisfactory ?". "Entirely so, so far as his integrity was con- cerned; although of course, it was no more agreeable to his creditors than to himself that he had to compromise with them." "Then why is he not again in business? Were there none who stood ready to offer him a helping hand ? '  Mr. Wilson's impatience as he asked this question, was evident. He had had much to do in such cases as Mr. Stout's, and to his honor be it spoken he had always stood by unfortunate debtors, and helped them up again, where he had reason to believe them honest men. "Yes," replied Mr. Norton. "Mr. Stout was not, and is not now, without friends who would assist him; buth be is out of health, and until he can know himself sufficiently recovered to give  24    0I!OW BENiNIE DID IT. such attention to business as he ought, he is too sensitive to risk bringing further losses upon those who would help him." "But he can-surely do something which would not make it necessary that this boy should break up study, and go to work,"' said Mr. Wilson, as a shadow of dissatisfaction gathered on his face. "The boy is neither designed nor desirous for a profession; and as it is evident that he must carve out his own fortune, both his parents and himself think there can be no better time than now that he should begin; and in addition to this, there are necessities in the case which must be met." Mr. Wilson's head for a moment dropped upon his hand, and he sat in earnest thought. Mr. Norton knew that his friend was no muser; the mind that could successfully work the huge machinery and compass the endless details of such a business as was done in that house was one that wasted but few moments, and could in but a moment devise great things. Therefore   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     25 Mr. Norton simply sat still, and let his friend "think it out." And it was thought out soon. "You intimately know the boy, Mr. Nor- ton," asked Mr. Wilson, raising his eyes ear- nestly to those of his friend. "I do," was the decided reply. "And you are not only seeking a situation for him, but will recommend him to me, will you?" "t I will, most emphatically," "Then, if it will suit you, I will be happy to see both yourself and him here to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock." Mr. Norton extended his hand, and rose, And it is no reproach to him to say, that at that moment a tear started to his eye. It was the "welling up " of a thankful heart, joyous with the " luxury of doing good." His pres- sure of Mr. Wilson's hand was so reciprocated by the latter as to leave no doubt that the hearts of the two friends, in the matter before them at least, were as energetically united as for the moment were their hands.   26     BIOW BENNIE DID IT. That evening lMr. Norton was an early visitor at the house of fMr. Stout, and we may as well add, a very welcome one, too. The whole family knew that he was their friend, for he was proving himself the same to them, nay more in their adversity, than he had been in their better days. "I will need you to-morrow morning, Ben- nie, if we live," said he, cheerfully, to his little friend. Bennie's face quickly brightened, for he well knew there was news with which he would be, pleased. His eager look was at once full of gratitude and inquiry, and he quietly awaited what his kind friend and teacher had to tell. 'O"You will please report yourself to me at my office, at a' quarter before ten o'clock to- morrow morning," said Mr. Norton. Bennie's countenance fell for a moment, but in a little time regained its brightness. "You do n't want to make a lawyer of me, do you, Mr. Norton?" said he.   HOW BElNNATIE DID IT.    27 ( Do n't 1," replied Mr. Norton, with an amused air, " why not?" "Because," answered the boy, "I have no inclination that way, and fear I should make a very poor one if I were to attempt it.' "Had you not better say," said Mr. Norton, "that you do n't want to bring yourself down to the level of us poor lawyers, because you prefer more respectable work?" - Bennie's confidence was by this time fully restored,; for he saw very evidently that M3r. Norton was only clouding his hopes for a mo- ment in order to make hiam increasingly happy with what there was to tell. So the boy con- fidently laid his hand in that of his kind friend, making no reply, yet by his earnest look mani- festing his desire that Mr. Norton skhpuld, with- out further delay, " come to the point." "Well," said Mr. Norton, "I am happy to say, that an excellent friend of mine has re- quested the pleasure of: your company and mine at his counting-room, on Court street, to morrow morning, at ten o'clock."   28    HOW BEN-IE DID IT. Bennie jumped up and clapped his hands. The cloud which had hung over his spirits for some days past, as he had contemplated the conflict of life, seemed to be dispelled in an instant. There was to him a double guarantee for hope. First, because it was an " excellent friend" of Mr. Nortoll's whom he was to meet, and next, because Court street was the loca. tion, -enough in itself to cheer and encourage him as to the character of the associations with which he might expect to be thrown. And the same satisfaction and pleasure was also mani- fest on the faces of all who were present, e-  deeply interested in the matter as they were. "Well," said Bennie, settling himself after a little, "I guess I'm ready now to know a little more, .Mr. Norton. You seern disposed to tell me a little at a time, and the times long be- tween. Will you please, now, let me know who the excellent 'friend of yours is who so kindly requests the pleasure of our company to-morrow morning " "His name is WILSON," said Mr. Norton, quietly.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     29 cNot Mr. George Wilson, 77 Court street?" exclaimed Bennie, eagerly awaiting a- reply. "Well, you say not," answered Mr. Norton, smifngly, " please tell me whyy not?" '"O Mr. Norton l"' replied Bennie with a disconcerted air, "I think you are somewhat provoking to-night, and are trying to see how far you can tease me." "Then I will stop treating you so badly, Bennie, at once, and will tell you all. It is Mr. George Wilson whom you and I are by engagement to meet to-morrow morning. And I assure you it is with no small degree of pleasure that I communicate this to you. The prospect of a place in such a house has much to encourage any youth, and I have very much confidence that if Mr. Wilson has an opening for you, you will not fail to see the advantage, and use it aright." "Indeed, indeed, Mr. Norton," c Bied Bennie, as a big tear started down his cheek, "I clan see the adjvantage of such a place, boy though I am; and if there were no other motives that n      30     HOW I BENNIE DID IT. would urge t-e to do my very best with Mr. Wilson, I would endeavor to for your sake, kind as you have been to me. But then I have so much else in my dear parents, sisters and brothers to stimulate me, that it seems to me that I shall fairly be surrounded with prompters to duty." ? Bennie threw his arms first about the neck of his mother, and then of his father, trying with a manly composure to restrain the tears that would come.  The change of circumstances in which he saw  these dear ones he had felt most keenly, and nobler heart never beat in ) any boy in such a case. He had said. little, but quietly, intelligently, and firmly, had re- solved much.  His father pressed him to his bosom  in full paternal pride, and he, too, had matured a firm resolve, that although he was sadly broken in health, he would nevertheless . use faithfully his business experience in daily lessons ia help for his generous boy. And t is he well knew would be no small capital with which for Bennie to begin. There would uc.-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      31 j    cessarily be many an occasion when a few words from the father's experience in life and busiless would be most helpful. And to the mother there seemed to come a strength and a joy and a hope that evening which was new, and whch enabled her to see in her son's future, not merely the aid which he-could bring to the family, but the blessing which he could be to himself and all with wlhom he would have to do. This was indeed to her a new life- vision, born as it were froln albove, and giving her a thrilling and blissful perception of what true life is. During all these many years, sur- rounded as she had been by an abundance of luxury, and not at any time having felt the need of exertion, she had accepted competence as a matter of course, and used it in what she had considered the consistent enjoyment of life-; not that- she had been selfish, not that she had restrained effort, watchfulness or prayer for her children, her husband or self; but there was that in the education she was now receiv- ing that she had never attained.  She was   32     HOW BENNIE DID IT. "waking out of sleep"; she was looking with joy upon the dawn of a new day, and she was unable to express the pleasure of the moment, as to her there came visions of victory and success for herself, Bennie, and all her house- hold in the conflict of life. 4 Oh, what a joy, thought she, to do, and in doing to have mind and heart buoyed up with love to man and love to God." What the reason of her present feel- ings was she could not comprehend, but in her view Bennie was going forth on a mission, the result of which was to be the development of great things for good; good for himself, her, her husband, her children, nay, for mankind, and the thought filled hbr with energy and made her happy. So they all made a joyful company that evening. Mr. Norton was especially happy, for he was largely in possession of the great secret of happiness, doing good.; and together they discussed  the great problem, building higher and higher calculations as light was more and more let into their views, until they   1          EHOW BENNIE DID IT.    - 33 got far along towards seeing how afflictions may prove blessings, and how even in poverty of purse, head and heart and life may obtain and disburse continually riches far greater than gold and diamonds. That night, though Bennie went to his bed hopeful and peaceful, he was long in getting to sleep; for, although his mind was in the enjoy- ment of as sweet a peace as he- had ever known, and was full of gratitude too, there' was, nevertheless, a going over and over for the tenth and twentieth and hundredth time, of all that he had been, and was now, but more  particularly of what he hoped to be in the long; future now stretching out before him. And almost the same mlight be said of his father and mother; for they seemed just now to be waking to, and realizing the fact that their son i    swas on the eve of a new existence, and the :i    excitement kept them wakeful. Nevertheless, they felt strong in hope, and at last both they and Bennie were relieved by sleep. * ll. ' I    CHAPTER III. BENNIE went forth the next morning made strong by his mother's kiss and his father's blessing. His baby sister, too, Susie, had done her share in warming his heart and making him courageous for his work. Throw- ing her arms about his neck, she kissed his cheeks and lips with an earnestness peculiarly her own; and as she saw a tear starting from his eye, she at once kissed and laughed it away, and then patting his cheek, exclaimed, "No, no, budder Bennie, no, no; budder Ben- nie's dot to be a man now." To which he responded as "a man " would, by brushing away the tear, and straightening himself up with an expression of countenance that was as much as to say, "Indeed, my darling little sister, you will see that 'budder Bennie' will be 'a man.' "   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     35 Punctually "it a quarter before ten o'clock he was at the door of Mr. Norton's office. "Come in," said a kind voice, the very tone of which was music to Bennie's ear, and heart too. "You are punctual, my dear boy," said Mr. Norton, turning his eye quickly to his clock. "Of course, sir," replied Bennie, with a decided though courteous tone; "I had not even thought of being otherwise." "I am happy to say, Bennie, that this is only what I expected, and I hope it will always be your purpose to be a reliable boy, as the sure foundation for being a reliable man. And to be so, too, in what are often considered small things, for these are what tend to make up character. Many, may be the occasions, if your life is spared, in which items that may appear small to you may be of great impor- tance to others; and it is a melancholy fact that there are vast numbers of persons in this world, who, although upright and correct in their gen- eral lives, are so unreliable in many of their   36     BOW BENNIE DID IT. small engagements as to almost entirely neutral- ize all their good efforts in other respects. But we must not trespass too much on our time; so you will please excuse me a moment or two, and I will walk with you." With a little graceful gesture, Bennie ex- cused Mr. Norton, and at once quietly set him- self so to disposing of the " moment or two" that "nothing should be wasted." The room in which he sat was Mr. Norton's "private office," and was in size about twenty feet each way. A door in the northern side led into the hall by which Bennie had come, and another on the eastern side opened into a larger office, where about half a dozen clerks were continu- ally engaged in writing and copying the various legal documents in connection with the extensive business which the prominent lawyer and coun- sellor had to do. Immediately opposite the first door was a fire-place, on the marble man- tel of which was a unique little old-style Ger- man clock, the pattern of which would have been to Bennie a study, if he had had more   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      37 than a "moment or two" to spare. Over this clock hung a tasteful frame, in which was set, an illuminated flying courier, from whose trum- pet were streaming the words       I "TIME IS PRECIOUS;. LET IT NOT BE'WASTED." In the recesses on each side of the fire-place were full length portraits of Clay and Web- ster; and in the distant corners of these recesses were neat little book-tables, on one of which was a huge dictionary, and on the other a  "universal atlas."  On either side of the eastern door was placed a large book-case and secretary combined, both of which were rich and  elegant pieces of furniture in their day, but such as would be considered too heavy and ungraceful to suit the style and taste of these modern times. On tire northern side of the office were old-fashioned portraits of men "great in the law," the two prominent of which were Marshall and Wirt, about which pictures were hung others of men of distinction, either in literature, statesmanship, or the law. Be-   88     HOW BENVIE DID IT. tween two front windows, which occupied mnuch of the western side of the room, was a full- size "Washington." This portrait was sus- pended just over a regular lawyer's " pigeon- hole desk," which was let down in front, and formed a writing-table, such as you may see now-a-days in -almost any office. And it was here that Mr. Norton was engaged during the "moment or two" for which he was excused, preparatory to walking with Bennie. So far as the office and its furniture were concerned, the reader has, of course, discovered nothing special in either; all was what we would now call old-fashioned, and unless it was that we would be taken with some -of the old portraits, as would an artist, we would not give much for the whole establishment. But there was some- thing which Bennie saw that made, a decided impression upon him, and which, with his idea of Mr.' Norton's habits, he would have been much surprised to have seen otherwise. The perfect order which pervaded everything, and the neatness, too, no particle of dust on either pic-   I!         HOW BENNIE DID IT.     3! ture, book, mantel, desk or table being visible, united to increase his good opinion of Mr. Nor-. ton, and, in addition, to fix firmer than ever in his own character similar purpose and habits. The i" moment or two " had done him good. "Now, my boy," said Mr. Norton, turning the key of his desk, " I am ready to accompany' you; and we must step pretty lively in order to hear Mr. Wilson's clock striking ten as we enter his office." Bennie was ready to " step lively " at once; and Mr. Wilson's clock was just pealing forth its "ten," when the lawyer and the boy received the merchant's pleasant salutation and invitation to be seated; and just then Bennie felt for the first time, that day at least, a singular sort of sensation, which was as though lis heart had started off on a journey, and was  about to settle in his throat. This, however, did not disturb him very long, for the traveller soon made another move towards its 'own proper location, and Bennie became as com-   40     HOW BEiVNIE DID IT. posed as he was while in the office of Mr, Norton. And there was much in the very kind manner of Mr. Wilson that put his young visitor thus at ease. Nay, we might say, there was much in the boy that contributed to the deportment of the man; for it would have been an indiffer- ent heart that would not have been favorably wrought upon even "on sight" of such a face and countenance as Bennie's. The girlish tint of his cheek and lip might have appeared too delicate for genuine boyhood; but to a ny one "well up" in physiognomy as Mr. Wilson professed to be, there were, in the steadiness of the full hazel eye, so shaded by dark lashes as to seem far darker than it really was, and the decided lines of the mouth, which were just the least relieved by a continual smile, enough to mark an energy and integrity of character that could not be mistaken. "You prefer a mercantile life, my boy, do you?" asked Mr. Wilson. "Yes, sir."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     41  Do you know that it involves very much hard labor and unfaltering application, if you i . would have success?" "Yes, sir," replied Bennie, resolutely; " but that is what I presume I might expect in any occupation, and not more, probably, as a merchant than in anything else." Ordinarily, Mr. , Wilson would have taken this reply for simply "what it was worth,"  as coming from a boy of Bennie's age, which indeed, many would say, was not much. But not thus did the observing merchant feel now; and not only was his confidence in the boy taking root, but his curiosity and his interest were stimulated so much that he wondered at himself. 'How old are you, Benjamin?" asked he. "A little over fifteen, sir; but 1 fear you will not form a very favorable opinion of my active habits if you judge them by the amount of growing I have done," replied Bennie, with a smile. "The greatest deeds are not always per-   ,42     HOW -BENNIE DID IT. formed boy the largest men, my boy," said Mr. Wilson; "and I don't know, except for appearance at a dress-parade or some similar occasion, but that very large men, at least, often a occupy more room than they do good." To this remark Bennie made no reply other than by a simple inclination of the head and expression of countenance, which was as much as to say that it was not his place, just there, to offer opinions too freely. "And how, Bennie," again inquired Mr. Wil- son, " do your father and mother like the idea of your leaving home so early to become a business man?" "They believe that it is for the best," answered Bennie, with an almost quivering lip, as he thought of the dear ones at home: "my parents are of the class of Christians who believe that 'not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our Heavenly Father's notice;' and they of course feel confident that present circum- stances will be made for our good as indi- viduals afnd as a family."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     43 What strange thoughts and queries were those which went like flashes through the great merchant's mind at this reply I Could it be that he was answered thus by a boy of but fifteen years of age? At any rate, could it be that the boy was doing anything more than repeating, parrot-like, answers which fanatical parents had taught him? Ah, how easily his earnest friend Mr. NORTON read his thoughts I and with what pleasure, too; for a healthful hope had taken possession of this Christian man, even that results were to come of this acquaintance and business connection such as would be for the merchant's everlasting good; for indeed Mr. NORTON had almost despaired of any means ever being brought to bear by which the indifference or skepticism which existed -in his friend's mind concerning his rela- tions to GOD and eternity would be removed. Mr. Wilson would have looked long into the clear and steady eye of the boy before him, and, even have penetrated the very workings of his mind and heart, had his pride and time   "    HOW BENNIE DID IT. permitted; for a spell seemed to come over him that was almost like the kindlings of a newa nature. "Boys were boys " to him, and to all intents and purposes one and the same thing: that is, they were a set of rollicking, heedless, and mischief-loving sprites that were of little value. But this boy to Mr. Wilson's view appeared to be a different material. "But hois it, my son, that your father did not accompany you here this morning?" con- tinued he. "My father and Mr. Norton thought it better that my first interview with you be as it is; after which, and before we would make any definite engagement, he will be very happy, at such time as may be agreeable to you, to meet you." "Which was doubtless the proper way," said Mr. Wilson; " inasmuch as it is through our mutual friend Mr. Norton that the introduction and acquaintance have been made and have progressed] as they have. Please take my chain, Benjamin, and let me see your handwriting."   BOW BENNIE DID IT.     45 And as Bennie was changing his seat, the eyes of the gentlemen exchanged glances, the meaning of which on the part of Mr. Wilson was a most satisfactory and hopeful opinion of the youth before them. Bennie's writing had not yet attained the rapid and easy cast of a business hand. The school-desk stiffness was in it; but it was very plain, and Mr. Wilson knew well enough that it would soon go through with the proper change. "I like your style, my boy," said he, lay- ing his hand kindly on Bennie's head, " and I think, if your father and I decide that you are to be placed in my hands, I will put you on -my personal' staff,' in this room. Business en- gagements now claim my attention (Mr. Norton and Bennie immediately rose); but as I would like to have a word or two with our friend Mr. Norton, I must waive ceremony and excuse you. Please say to your father that I will be happy to see him at three o'clock this afternoon, and if matters are satisfactory, you may report yourself to me for duty at nine o'clock to-mor- row morning."   "    HOW BENNIE DID IT. Bennie bade the gentlemen a respectful good morning, and retired. His heart, how- ever, was so full towards hisi kind friend and teacher, that as the latter offered him his hand in parting, he returned the friendly token with an earnest pressure. Mr. Wilson alsol ex- tended his 'hand cordially, and Bennie with- drew. "There is much in that boy, friend Norton," said. Mr. Wilson. "There is much in almost any boy," replied Mr. Norton, with rather a teazing expression. The  merchant smiled  as  he replied, t"There you are again. Knowing my general antipathy to the young rascals, you are just now very complaisant in the feeling that you have gained a victory over me. Well, I'll ac- cept my defeat amiably, and if this protege of yours is to be the instrument of any reforma- tion in me, instead of objecting, I will endeavor to be willing and thankful." "A" wise determination," said Mr. Norton, "and I assure you it is with much pleasure that   HOW BENNIE DID -IT.     47 I hear you so speak. It would be creditable to either of us to be willing to learn even from a boy. You spoke truly when you said there was much in this our young friend, and as his tastes seem to have a mercantile shaping, you may have in your hands the germ of a man- hood that will not only make its mark in the world for good, but will prove an inestimable blessing to yourself.'"  Somehow Mr. Wilson had been thinking the ' same thing. Literally speaking, the number of youth and young men who had passed through the various grades as employees in his house might have been called an army: but his rela- tion with the whole of them had been purely a business transaction. Correct habits and gen- eral commercial integrity he had always re- quired; but this had been not so much the result of a moral purpose, that was virtuous for virtue's sake, as of what might be called hon- orable ideas of trade. Amongst thousands of men in the business world, there is no doubt just such a feeling as this, within whose inner   48     HOW BENNIE DID IT. nature the deep undercurrent of a religious perception of life's relationships has never coursed. When their ledgers are" up," their "balance sheets " agreeing, and no especial case in their memories where a customer might say how much he had been cheated, they feel them- selves all right; and with the utmost compo- sure they lock up their safes'and themselves as though there could be no fqrther claims upon them. Of them it may will be said, " they have eyes but they see not;,and ears have they but they hear not." Ah, how different are their views of their relations to God and their , o0 fthow-men when the "eyes of their under- standing " are opened. Here was Mr. Wilson, than whom, as a man of the strictest comimer- cial integrity, none stood higher in all Court * street. Could any in all his army of emlloyees say that he had wronged them? None: that is so far as the letter of his contracts went. On the contrary, he had ever been a liberal, and generous employer, paying better salaries on the average than many others did for the   OW BtENNIE DIVD IT      49 same grades of service.  But here his sense of obligation rested. Now, however, as in a jj!   moment, ".scales " seemed to be dropping from , his eyes, and a revolution in motives took place i: g  in his mind. Not only confidential clerks, but salesmen, clerks in general, boys, messengers, and porters, all seemed to come nearer to him     as though some fairy's wand had made all "j ^these his children and   brothers. So from henceforth there was a bond of sympathy be- ji  tween  Mr. Wilson  and all of his workers h which the latter soon noticed, exactly how they could n't say, and they were conscious of a personal interest both in their employer and his business which they had not felt before. Xi {jj"I thank you, friend Norton," said Mr. Wil- son, ' for bringing that boy to me." "No, Mr. Wilson, it was I   who petitioned [D jyou to grant me the favor of bringing him, and m!; .I am therefore the one to express the thanks," replied Mr. Norton. Mj" "You may feel about it just as you please," answered Mr. Wilson, earnestly, , and express i i   &^  :   50     HOWT BENNIE DID IT. just as many thanks as you please, and I, too, will do the same, for I certainly amn thankful that you have brought him to me." "You like him, then?" No."'  "No!" said Mr. Norton, with a surprised tone; "I am at a loss to understand you." "I love him!" Mr. Norton laughed outright. But almost immediately he looked very thoughtful, as though some unpleasant fear had taken posses- sion ofhim. ( What's the matter?" asked Mr. Wilson. "I am almost afraid that some new-fledged enthusiasm has seized upon you, which might do harm." "To whom?" "To yourself, first," - "And to our young Bennie next and most?" added Mr. Wilson, interrupting him. "Yes." "You are correct, friend Norton; and if, he is to be with me in a business relation, I must   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     51 be careful; else the very kindly feeling which he has inspired within me may make me over- lenient. I seem just now to be understanding as I never did before the feelings of an over- fond and too indulgent parent, and whence come 'spoiled children.' Either there is something especially attractive about. this boy, naturally, or there has been unusual care exer- cised by his parents to make hidn so." "Possibly there is a reason for your sudden and peculiar admiration of him quite different from what you have supposed," said Mr. Nor- ton. "What can it be?" asked Mr. Wilson, eagerly. "I am not certain that you are yet fully able to appreciate the reason if I suggest it. But you know there is a possibility of our looking upon any object with different feelings at dif- ferent times. And it is doubtless true that you have not had, even in your large experience, any boy brought to you under just such circum. stances as this one has been. There can be uo   52-    BOW BENNIE DID IT. doubt that he is on sight a prepossessing boy, made so, however, as much by culture as from natural appearance. His parents' circum- stances, too, have doubtless greatly stimulated your sympathy. In addition to this, an old and close friend has manifested a special interest in him, giving you to understand, too, that he wanted the boy to be with you for your sake as well as the boy's. But after all, there may be a deeper reason. Your heart is -doubtless now touched, so that you discern obligations in a new light. And I'll venture to assert that you are not looking so much to the dollars and cents' results in your engagement with Bennie as to an undefinable sort of pleasure which you anticipate from having him near you." Mr. Wilson dropped his head for a moment, as though he would have to review and sift what Mr. Norton had been talking about in order to understand it. "After all," said he, "friend Norton, why would it not be as easy, and certainly as short for you to say that I love the boy?"   HO I BENNIE DID IT.     53 "Because it would not be true." "It would n't, eh? What sort of a thing is love, in your view?" asked Mr.- Wilson, sur. prised. "Well, I can't say exactly how the books, define it, but it is certainly a something more than is stirred on sight by a comely face or a polished address. As the world goes, love is quite a piece of selfishness, grown more by what the object does for us than what we do for it. That beautiful and hope-inspiring text in the Bible, John 3d chapter and   16th verse, says 'For God- so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, tttat whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' Now, so far as all -the evidence we have received goes, ' the world' had never done anything much calcu- lated to induce God to love it. And there is another most delightful text, too, in which our Saviour, speaking to his disciples, John 15th chapter, and 5th verse, says, 'As the Father   54    iHOOY B ENWI E DID IT. hath loved me, so have I loved you.' JHe loved what was untlovely, and yearned, over that which lhe wished to benefit and bless. And I would not wonder jif it was now some- what of that feeling which is budding into existence within yourself. Not that you have been a selfish man, for you certainly have not; but you have looked at the world and your fellow-man with the world's eye, and thus influ- enced, the liveliest sympathies as well as the most benevolent actions fall short in their exer- iese of that exalted motive which does all for the glory of God." " Is there not a text in the Bible, friend Nor- ton," asked Mr. Wilson," which says something about'seeing men as trees, walking?' " "There is." "And it occurs in connection with the open- ing of a blind man's eyes, does n't it?" "Just so, exactly," replied Mr. Norton. "Then I am about far enough along to see the trees; but I have to confess that as yet, my sS   HOW BENNISE DID IT.     55 vision is too muddled to understand, or see clearly this matter in the light in which you are presenting it." "WIich is about what I thought," said Mr. Norton; , milk, you know, is for babes; but I am quite hopeful that you will, in due time, be able to relish and digest stronger food. And now I think it time that I was bidding you good morning.  It will probably not be long before you will see me again, as my visits here will be stimulated by a double motive." 4 And so the friends parted. r"      We   CHAPTER IV. AT the hour named by Mr. Wilson, Mr. Stout was at the office. A formal introduction was unnecessary, as each was known of the other. The reception was not at all of the " patron- izing" cast, but so cordial and manly as in a moment to relieve Mr. Stout of all embar- rassment. The fact was, that Mr. Wilson thought that the father of such a boy as Ben- nie was rather, of the two, the one who occu- pied the more advantageous ground. "I am happy indeed, Mr. Stout, to meet you," said Mr. Wilson, seating his visitor in his own elegant office chair. "A pleasure truly reciprocated on my part," was Mr. Stout's reply. And then how greatly different was all their conversation from that of two men engaged in   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      57 a mere business trade. For on the part of Mr.. Stout, there was the speaking out of an earnest father's heart, as it yearned with deepest anxiety over a much loved son and longed for  his truest, prosperity. And on the part of Mr. Wilson there was the newly begotten feeling of love for the boy, coupled with a special awakening of interest, or as it might be, cu- riosity, in the case; and he appreciated the father's feelings, too, more than he had ever before those of any parent who had proposed putting a son with him. I am going through a new experience, Mr. Stout," sal Mr. Wilson, " and feel almost as though I were just placing myself into the hlands of a tutor." "Then, my dear sir," replied Mr. Stout, " for Benjamin's sake, at least, I hope you will be especially careful. There are cases, I am con- fident, in which the boy may be teacher to the mnan; but I trust you will always bear in mind that for the good of both of you it is necessary that Benjamin should always see in you that   58  I0HOW BENNIE DID II. which will command his respectful obedience and confidence. In maintaining steadily before him the position of the one to whom he is to look for guidance. and to whom he is to be responsible, you will the more develop in him the energy that will be essential to his usefulness and success. Do not, I pray you, beget in him too soon such a spirit of self-con. fidence as leads to vanity; little as you may think it, the danger now is that you may go to this injudicious extreme. This, I hope, will not be the case, but rather that you will exact from Benjamin everything of attention and duty. Thus you may make him a man in the proper sense; and the strong foundation of moral and religious principle upon which his parents have taught him to build, and in fact upon which I truly believe he is building, will give him a strength for supporting not only his interests but yours." The'gentlemen parted, their engagement for Bennie being that he should report himself for duty on the following morning. Mr. Wilson   iHO V BENNIE DID IT.    59 drew his chair to his desk, and with pen in hand addressed himself to his work; but it was hard to fix his mind properly on the letters and other features of business that lay piled on his desk awaiting attention, although his own business hours for the day were about closed. "A worthy father and a worthy son," said he to himself, as the conversations which he had had with both of them lingered in his mind. "All, how different the views and aims of this father from the dozens of others who have sought places for their sons in my houses- Money, money, money-; while they may not have said it, they ; have, nevertheless, so evi- denced their aims and ends, as to make it plain enough that money was the point! ' Make my son, if possible, a shrewd business man,' has been their cry. And what, too often, have their ideas been of a shrewd business man? Evidently one who by all the minutiae of schlem ing and twisting can take advantage of his neighbor, putting one article of merchandise up and another down, 'sampling' goods just   60     HOW BENNIE DID IT. so as to make them 'pass,' holding this item so that the light will fall upon it, and that so it wont, and resorting to various other 'tricks of trade' which, although not downright steal- ing in themselves, are most certainly so as far as the principle and intent of the action are con- cerned. A pity indeed it is that there are such men, and a blessing, on the other hand, that there are some such as the one with whom I have been talking. But then," continued he, with his soliloquy, 'why is it that such men as Mr. Stout come to such necessitous circum- stances as he is in? This troubles me. Well, well, this at present I am not to know; there is doubtless a wise design in it all, which, in the proper time, will come to the light. Now, I cannot possibly understand it, and I would be unwise to believe nothing which I cannot entirely comprehend." So after shaping up the odds and ends 4. of such business matters as were necessary to be attended to that day, and putting others so that each would come in its proper order in   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      61 the morning, Mr. Wilson closed his desk and started for his home. Being a. very methodical man, not only in his transactions but his hours, his extra half hour in his office on this day was noticed by some of his clerks ,and remarked upon. It was his habit on leaving his private office to pass through that of his confidential clerk, in which there were generally two or three young men writing; then through the main counting-room, from which he went along through the second floor of the building, and descended thence to the first, in the rear end, along which he passed to the street. This necessarily " filed him through " a large number of his employees, of various grades of service; and all of these, so far as they might be at the moment in close range of contact with his walk out and in, he was in the habit of courteously saluting. But this -afternoon he lingered here and there from desk to desk, pleasantly asking a question concerning a ship- ment, the condition and quality of certain lines of goods, the reports as that day received from x,   62     I(HOW BENNIE DID IT. such and such vessels,-the comparative de- mand between the present and a former given time for some specialty, either foreign or domes- ! tic, and similar questions according to the   M , department," all of which was so pleasantly - done as to make all hands feel as though a new opening had been made into the building, through which the gladdening sunbeams were playing where they had never shone before. As we have before said, Mr Wilson's employees had always liked him, respected him, and admired him for his wonderful business sagacity and success,- but they had never loved him. *' NINE O'CLOCK " found Bennie promptly in the office of Mr. Wilson's confidential clerk, and the latter, as instructed by his employer the" afternoon before, seated the boy in the pri- vate office. "Your waiting will be very short," said the clerk, with a significant smile, as he looked at the clock. Bennie knew that this meant that Mr. Wilson was a prompt man. Five minutes,   HOW BENNIE DID -I.     63 however, and then ten minutes passed, and yet the merchant did not come. Bennie was sur- prised, but his good sense fell back on the recollection that there are always many things that can hourly occur to prevent even a prompt man from   meeting his engagements to the minute. So 'casting away all his risings of apprehension, he looked about to see how he might be occupying his time. From the mo- ment that he entered the office he was struck with the air of untidiness and discomfort which-- seemed to exist, so different from the condition he had observed everything as being in the day before. The morning was a very warm one in June, and as one side of the office opened east. ward, and the Venetian awnings of both the windows had not been dropped, the sun's rays were poulring in steady and hot. Mr. Wilson's desk, too, was quite covered with dust, though on it were lying a huge pile of letters such ap Bennie thought no ordinary man could give ' proper attention-to in one day. A morning paper was lying on the desk and another on-   "    HOW BE NATIE DID IT. the floor. To Bennie's mind there was but one reason for all this, which was the absence or extreme carelessness of the porter, whose duty it was to have the office in order. That Mr. Wilson would allow such a condition of things in his office habitually, putting matters himself to rights when he came, hardly was an allow- able conjecture in Bennie's mind; so the boy concluded he would himself do the work that somebody ought to have done an hour be- fore. And this was not much sooner thought of than done, for Bennie quickly had the win- dows, and t e western door which led into the second floor ware-room open, the awnings down, the duster going, and matters in general, walk- ing into order. He was just about putting on the finishing touches when Mr. Wilson opened the southern door, coming from the confidential clerk's office, and stood for a moment holding its knob and looking at Bennie with surprise. The boy colored,-tthough he had been detected doing something for which he had no authority. And there came, too, a sort oi   HOW BEVENNIE DID IT.    65 flashing thought to his mind, just at that mo- ment, that if it were true that he had found Mr. Wilson's room that morning only in its usual condition, the latter might take this volunteer work as a reproof, and be offended.  The cheerful smile, however, with which the mer- chant's face soon glowed sent this fear to the winds. "Good morning, Benjamin," said Mr. Wilson, pleasantly, and advancing towards his desk; "you seem to understand how to go to work without waiting for instructions." "Yes, sir," replied Benjamin, bowing cour. teously; "your office was simply in such very great disorder when I came in as to *make me see at once that something had occurred that was unusual, and as I knew it would be un. pleasant for you to find matters as they were, I thought there could be no impropriety in my making them more agreeable for you." "Which was a common-sense conclusion, my boy, even although you had not yet been in- ducted into office, and for which I thank you,"   "OV BENNIE DID IT. said Mr Wilson. Then opening the "clerks' door," he inquired if "Edward" had not yet been in the office. "I thought I heard him in there a short time before you came, sir," was the reply. Mr. Wilson touched a spring beside his desk, summoning some one from the lower floor. In a moment or two a young man entered the office. "Is Edward on your floor?" asked Mr. Wil- son.  "No, sir." "Have you seen him this morning?" "I thought he was here an hour or more since, sir," replied the man, assuming a think- ing tone; "but I cannot certainly remember, as I was quite busy at that time myself." "Please inquire about him, Mr. TWright, and let me know," said Mr. Wilson.   Bennie learned the lesson at once that Mr. Wilson )was not a man who was in the habit of permitting neglect of duty to pass without proper investi. gation.   "I hope Benjamin," continued Mr. Wilson, turning to Bennie, "that you have not formed a bad opinion of my habits, either as regards time or order. First impressions are said to be lasting, so I would prefer that you would not consider to-day's as your first impressions of me; yesterday's I hope were bettel. My tardiness this morning has a satisfactory ex- cuse, and as for the untidiness and disorder of my office, Edward will doubtless be able to answer for himself." "I had already decided these things in my own mind, Mr. Wilson, just as you have stated them," replied Bennie, respectfully. The merchant made no other answer than that of a gratified smile, as he turned to the enormous pile of letters which seemed to say, "t give us your attention, for we have been wait- ing long enough." "You may look over this list a few moments," said he to Bennie, handing him a "stock-list," of various items of merchandise then in store, with present quotations of prices attached.   68     HOW BENNIE DID IT. It' was about ten o'clock when Mr. Wilson had completed opening and looking through his letters. Envelopes were then comparatively a new feature, and being not yet in universal use, all the letters were not so enclosed. But Mr. Wilson had adopted the habit of preserving and " filing away " such envelopes as came, just -as he did his letters; that is, they were all folded of uniform width and length, and had indorsed on one end the post-office from which they came, by whom  sent, and the date on which they werd received. As each letter was opened, its envelope was therefore laid aside until all were put together, of the mail then to hand, after which the filing away of both let- ters and envelopes was properly attended to by a subordinate clerk. This morning the number was very large, and would require considerable work. In a cosy little corner of Mr. Wilson's own office there stood a neat desk and chair; no one was at work there, and Bennie was won- dering what had become of the young man whom   HOW BENNIE' iDID IT.    69 he had noticed there the day before when Mr. Norton and himself were present, and whom Mr. Wilson had" excused " when they came in. He soon had his curiosity satisfied. "You may take a seat at this desk for the present, Benjamin," said Mr. Wilson, at the same time gathering the pile of envelopes and laying them on: the desk. On one side of the room were a number of neat green boxes about two feet in length by about one in width. On the front end of each box were the letters G. W., painted in white; and in addition to this were the figures " 1850," " 1851," etc., etc. The boxes had sliding tops, and as Mr. Wilson drew back one of these covers he took "out a  systematic looking package which contained a number of envelopes, all which had been received during a certain week,-- as indorsed upon them,--of the  year painted on' the box. "For the present, Benjamin," said   3r. Wilson, "you may occupy yourself in filing away these envelopes as you see these have   70     HOW BENNIE DID IT. been in this package. It is work in which you can't have any extraordinary ranve for the development of genius; but you know you have to begin somewhere, and you might probably have made the beginningf at something even less agreeable than this." "I had to learn my A B C's when first I went to school, sir," replied Bennie, respect- fully, "and business of course has its A B C's which are just as necessary as are those of the school." Mr. Wilson only replied with an approving smile, for he had too much business before him just then to give further attention to his pupil. So Bennie with quite a happy heart tookl the seat at his desk, and applied himself to hs A B Cs.  Opening the package which had been handed to him for a pattern, he care- fully noted the whole style of indorsement, so that he might be sufficiently acquainted with it, and not in the slightest respect make a wrong beginning. Then taking the envelopes he folded them through the centre; laid them all   HOWT BELANIE DID IT.     71 with the address rlnning one way, pressed them compactly together, and so had them ready for indlorsement. His first pen-work as a " business- man " was on the margin of an envelope, and ran thus: -- '"SUPERCARGO Or' SHP EARNESTo Bordeaitx, May 15, 18 - Rec'cl. June 15, 18 -." Just as he was fairlygetting into his work, there was a knock at the outer door. :; Corne, said M3I. Wilson; and a young man evidently a porter, entered. He was the "Ed- ward " who was the delinquent of the morning. Mr., Wilson turned to the young man with a look of earnest inquiry, but asked no question, leaving him to state his case. "I fear, sir," said Edward, respectfully, "tlhat you found your office in a very unsightly con- dition this morning." "Indeed, I did not," replie d Mr. Wilson, O   72     HO I BENNIE DID IT. looking about, his office withi a forced look of surprise. "Did not?" exclaimed the young man, not a little amazed. "No, sir." "Well, sir," said Edward, regaining com- posure, "I have to confess that I left it so." "And why did you do so?" "I had but just commenced my work here when I had occasion to leave suddenly by a call from home which, with your permission, I will satisfactorily explain at another time," re- plied the young man. "Your excuse you think I would consider satisfactory, do you?" asked, Mr. Wilson. "Without any doubt, sir," was the answer. "Very well, Edward," said 'Mr. Wilson, "I have thus far had no occasion to reprove you, and will certainly not do so now. I accept your word implicitly, and you need make no further explanation in this case." The young man expressed his thanks, bowed respectfully, and retired. r*          Xi   HOW BE NNIE DID I IT.    73 Upon Bennie, the very kind though firm man- ner of Mr. Wilson in this matter made a decided impression for good. There was a delicacy and a consideration for the feelings of the young man, coupled with an expression of confidence, which everybody could not have shaped and blended in exactly the same way. But Bennie- of course said nothing, and Mr. Wilson turned to his correspondence without any remark. Mr. Wilson went entirely through with his letters, not making any immediate effort himself to reply to any of them. Occasionally glanc- ing his eye that way, Bennie noticed a kind of "'sorting out" process going on. There were at least half a dozen divisions of the pile, each of which was kept in place by a "weight." One of the parcels was made up, of letters with which nothing was yet done except to put them by themselves, all opened, and ready for attention at the proper time. To the other parcels, additions were made steadily, but not until Mr. Wilson had hastily pencilled a few    74     HOW BENNIE DID IT. words on each. So in due time this part of the work was done; whereupon Mr. Wilson touched a bell which soon brought clerks, each of which was the "head of his department," from various parts of the house. One by one these gentlemen received the letters with a word or two of explanation or order, until all who had answered the bell were supplied; after which they bowed and retired. Bennie was working, and observing too. It would have been easy for almost any one to have seen that there was a machinery at work in that vast house which moved beautifully; but it required a quick and intelligent perception to understand the points-in the machinery, and to know how very necessary some of the parts were that only seemed ornamenal. When these clerks had retired, Mr. Wilson took one of the renmaining piles of letters, and, calling the "confidential clerk" handed the lot to him, but the latter did not leave with them until he and Mr. Wilson had gone throughl with more or less of conversation and consultation   HOW BENNrIE DID IT       75 concerning their contents, and t  answers to be written. There now remained some ten or- fifteen letters, being those in the sorting which Mr. Wilson had placed together without writing comlment or instruction upon them. These he had reserved for personal attention, ald now sat down to the work.  The first one he took up was as follows:- "NEW ORLEANS, ----, 18-. "MR. GEORGE WILSON, Q--: ("Dear Sir, --In accordance with your instructions, I loaded and despatched ship ' Sunlight' from this port for Liverpool on the first day of last March. You will remember that to complete her cargo I purchased one thousand sacks of yellow corn, notifying you thereof by early mail, and instructed the consignee out to sell at once if there was only a margin that -would cover freight. I received prompt returns of sales made at mre of an advance than was anticipated, the purchger buying under permit on shipboard, but with the understanding that the corn should remain on board for a specified number of days. The sample sack, from which sale was made, was just unde} the midship hatch, and was stowed in a third or fourth' tier below the deck, the sacks which had covered it                     .   76      HOW BENNIE DID IT. having been removed ,n order to get out a satisfactory sample. The money was paid at once. On expiration of the time, the corn was unloaded, but much to the surprise of both buyer and seller, a considerable lot of it was damaged, for which the buyer makes recla- mation, proposing no other 'court of adjudication' than yourself. So far as the samples are concerned, on which I made the purchase, there was the same reason to believe the lot good as had the Liverpool buyer. It is a singular case, and hard to know in whose hands the damaging began. "Awaiting your instructions in the case, "I remain, "Very respectfully yours, "JOHN MARTIN." The letter was not a very legible one, and to an   untutored eye could  only be cyphered I out slowly. The spelling was perfect; but it was almost impossible to know what some of the words were. This, however, gave Mr. , Wilson an idea upon which'he acted quickly. "Can you read all sorts of writing, Ben- jamin," asked he, handing over the letter to his "raw recruit." "I have seen a great many sorts, sir," replied   HO W BENNIE DID IT.     " he, "-and some that would puzzle almost any- body to read." "Well," .said Mr. Wilson, turning again to his desk,- "you can probably occupy a little time profitably in going over this one." "Thank you, sir," and Bennie went at 'it. But he had- to " scratch- his head " considerably before he came to the bottom of it. And then he took a new start, going through it a second and a third time, until he had it thoroughly. But when this was done, he laid the letter square out before him, put his cheeks/in his hands, his elbows on the desk, and sat as though there was something in the letter at which he " stuck." Mr. Wilson was observing hiln from " under the corner of his eye." "Can you make it out Benjamin?" asked he. "Oh, yes, sir," was the reply, "I accomr- plished that much several minutes ago." "And ynu are nou admiring the chirography, arle you?"   78     HO W BI ENIE DID IT. "Indeed I am not, sir. So far as that is con- cerned, my wonder is that any man who really has business in him can be content to send out' letters so poorly written." "I thought you seemed to be very much oc- cupied with the letter for some reason,", said Mr. Wilson. tAnd you thought correctly, sir," replied Bennie. "Well," said Mr. Wilson, turning full upon the boy and looking at him with an expression of earnest interest, " if you have no objections to telling me, I would much like to know what there is about it that so much interests you." 'I will tell you with much pleasure, sir, be- cause it seems, to me that here is an oppor- tunity on the very first day of my commerlcial life for me to learn much. In the first place this letter has opened my eyes to the fact that in the experience of such a business man as yourself, having so many different kinds of nmen with whom to deal, and with transactions of such a varied character, there must be a great   HOW BE NNIE DID IT.    79 many tlings which not only test patience and judrgment, but also jrinciDle." Mr. Wilson looked as though he hardly knew whetler lto smile or look grave. As we have said beforlc, hle had liad much to do with boys; and in :t-ie mlain he had found that boys t/hey Wzcce, and colltinued to be too often when in his opiL io:l they onlllt to hiave "put ofT childish things." But in the first place he had ever been too -sweeping in the opinio0.1r thus foImed; and in the next, Much that he had found that was lacking in thllc. was as surely his fault as theirs. Onll this point, lowever, he was not yet fully educated, and in'his estimlate of Bon- nie, the opinion was simply that here was an "old head on young shoulders." Thlat boys in general should talk of business matters putting not only " patience and judgment, but 1princi)le to the test" would be, an absurd idea; men weIe not enoug1h up to that point yet, and surely thley knew, or ought to know, more than boys. "That mllch you thought of in thst place,   80     HOW BEN VIE DID IT. Benjamin," said Mr. Wilson; "what were you thinking of in the second?" "I was wondering what your decision would be in this case, sir." ' It was quickly made," replied Mr. Wilson. Bennie thought it'would be improper for him to put the question direct for it, but he looked as thoughti he would much like to know whlat the decision was. "Probably it would be a healthy little piece of discipline for you," said Mr. Wilson, " to put on paper what you would like to say in reply to the case, just as though you were the arbi- trator to whom it had been submitted. True, such work will hardly seem in keeping with A B C study, but we can go on the presump- tion that in morals you took the primary les- "sons sufficiently long ago to make you now a pretty well advanced scholar." Saying which, Mr. Wilson resumed his work, and Beinie took pen, ink, and paper, and wrote thus: S"Q--, June 16, 18-. C MR. JOHN MARTIN: "DEAR SIR: I have received your letter concerning   HOW .BE NIE DID IT.      81 the thousand sacks of corn damaged on board of the ship 'Sunlight.' You will please refund the money at once, to the full amount of the corn that was found damaged. "Respectfully yours, "GEORGE WILSON." When he had finished his letter he quietly laid it aside, feeling a kind of hesitation at letting Mr. Wilson know either that it was- written or what was in it, and resumed his work of indorsing envelopes.  Nearly   one o'clock had come, and he wanted his dinner. Soon the clock struck., "If you please, Mr. Wilson," said he, "t this is my dinner hour. Will it be agreeable to you that the time remain as it is?" l"For the present, yes," replied Mr. Wilson. "You have made your reply to that letter, I suppose."  "Yes, sir," answered Bennie rather timidly as thoughl he would have preferred thattie question should not have been asked. "I laid it inside the desk."'  I think I would like to see it."     o ' 6   82     HOW BENNIE DID IT. Bennie rather reluctantly produced his letter. Not that he was in the least ashamed of what he had written, for he felt that he had only said what conscience and honor demanded., But lie did not know how it would accord with Mr. Wilson's views, and he did not like the possibility of opening even the slightest breach with his employer, especially at so, early a time -as this. "I will not detain you," said Mr. Wilson, keeping his eyes steadily on the letter which he was writing; "you may go, and I will look presently at what you have written." Bennie had not gone very far before Mr. Wilson gave his letter attention. Its concise- ness astonished him. He would hardly have believed that a half dozen or so lines would have been all that was considered necessary by any one who had not been actually driven to terseness of -style by an enormous correspon- dence. But he did not waste much time on this feature of the letter, for there :was some- thing else of far more importance which  o              . ^    ,    "-OW BENNIE DID IT.    83 ,  I  -    attracted hi attention; and this was nothing t     more nor less than the way in which in this "test of principle," principle was so speedily "\    and decidedly the victor in the fight. It is probably not too much to say, that he gave the letter half a dozen readings.  When Bennie had told him that he had -been wonder ing what the decision in the case would be, Mr. Wilson had replied that it was ' quickly made.': And this was true, for the merchant was "a man of his word." But somehow he felt quite glad just now that although the decision had been quickly made, it had not been as quickly told. For the fact was, it was somewhat difer- ent from the one which he still held in hand, and which seemed intent on sticking there the balance of the day. "Refund the money at once," read he, half aloud; " that's- emphatic, dispenses with argu- ment, and is very good for the buying side of the corn." "To the full amount of the corn found dam: aged," continued he; "that certainly is liberal   84     HOW BENNIE DID IT. and no mistake. Well, master Benjamin, it's to be hoped you will- always have an easy Lank account if you propose thus to settle against yourself all the breakages, bruisages, stealages, and wettages that may be reported back upon you." But notwithstanding this, he kept Bennie's letter in hand, and gave it another reading. "Well, after all," said he to himself, " is n't the boy right? Had n't the buyer of that corn the right to expect that -it would be sound? That it was not thoroughly inspected proves nothing in our favor, nor does the item of its remaining on board during the number of days as per agreement. Those days were too few to make any serious damaging unless it was already begun sy bad stowage, ventilation, leakage, or something else. And- although I can't boast that I looked at the matter' exactly in this light at first, I am inclined to the opinion that the juvenile judge has made nearer than I the proper decision. But as long as I have sought what I of course concluded would be   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     81 the moral aspects of the case, I think I'll go a little further, and see what commercial astute ness would say. A multitude of counsellors may not help the matter out much, as sucet things as this would usually go, but they will certainly give it a little spice in the way oj variety."  So he called in his confidential clerk. "Mr. Leonard," said he, "I have a lettel from our friend Martin, of New Orleans, which you will please take to your desk, and lead lei. surely. I had quickly made up my opinion about it, but on second thought am inclined to change. When you have given it such consid. eration as you may think necessary, please commit your opinion to paper, just as though you were writing the letter of instructions in reply." "Yes, sir," answered the clerk, taking the letter, which he commenced at once reading on his way to his desk.          . "I'll guarantee one thing," said Mr. Wilson -. -   to himself, " nay, I 'll guarantee two; first, that   86    HOW BENNIE DID IT. Mr. Leonard wont come to the point with fewer words than did the boy, and next that he'll not make the same decision." Whereupon he put the matter from his mind for the time being, and resumed his other work. In the mean time Bennie had reached home, been greeted with kisses and caresses by the dear ones there, who had been anxiously await- ing his return, and had been composedly enjoy. ing his dinner. There was great satisfaction expressed by his parents when they heard how kindly Mr. Wilson had received him, and they were specially pleased to learn that their be- loved boy was assigned a place in the mer- chant's own office. Very naturally much of the home conversation through that dinner hour turned upon Bennie's occupation during the morning. And it was no small amount of interest that his parents manifested when he told them of the New Orleans letter, and how Mr. Wilson had drawn out his opinion of the matter. This feature caused Mr. Stout consid- erable uneasiness, for he feared that the very   X          HBOW BENNIE DID-. IT.    87 danger concerning which he had cautioned Mr. Wilson seemed singularly imminent. He well enough knew that the apparently familiar way with which Mr. Wilson was receiving Bennie was a thing unusual; and that the merchant should do what appeared to be bringing a boy as it were into the position of adviser in a -question involving much both of money and principle was to say the least a strange pro- ceeding. Therefore he was perplexed, and felt like doing something he didn't know ex. actly what. Nevertheless, he concluded to let the matter rest as it was for the present, trust- ing that there would come an issue better than his fears. This- much, however, he did, that is to approve his son's manner and decision about the letter, doing so, however, with that kind of counsel which he felt would be a guard against the rising of vanity, and keep him in a respect- ful and modest position., There was no particular reason for the father's fears. Mr. Wilson had made his own   88     HOW BENNIE DID IT. plans, and was only beginning to work them out in his own way. He had never formed the habit of "spoiling" anybody in his employ, whqther boys or men; and although for rea- sons which will appear as we get further along, he was " making a new tack " in Bennie's case, he had no more intention of unduly compro- mising himself or- unwisely favoring the boy than does the sailing master give up the pur- pose of making his port, though he may have to " tack " through half the voyage to it. Bennie's time was up, and he prepared to return to his work. Again were little Susie's arms about his neck, and her lips pressed to his cheek. "Budder Bennie's certain to be a man," said she, encouragingly, "sister Sudie knows that; and some of these days, papa and mamma and Sudie and Katie and Willie 'll all be so proud of him. Dood-bye, Bennie-- be a dood boy,- ., no, no, a man, I rdean." Her brother drew her to his heart, and told   HEOW BENNIE DID IT.     89 her to ask God every day to bless Bennie, and make him strong to be a "dood man." Then he went away with increasing courage. and strength to engage in the life's warfare which he had so hopefully began. f]   OHAPTIER V. THE LETTER which had been put into Mr. Leonard's hands had by this time received several very careful readings. Had  it not been given to him by Mr. Wilson just as it was given, he would doubtless have settled the question quickly. But Mr. Wilson's manner evidently meant more than the clerk was pre- pared at first sight to comprehend. "I don't see anything very difficult about the case," said he to himself. "The buyer of that corn saw what he was buying, that is, com- mercially speaking. Not only was he evidently satisfied with that immediately at the hatch, but he went down as many tiers as he thought neces- sary to get a proper idea of its condition. And he was 'sufficiently satisfied to close the   i SOW BENNIE DID IT.    91 purchase and pay the money. Furthermore he knew well that he was dealing with parties who were themselves the most honorable, and L  would be the farthest from committing such a fraud, even had they known that it would not be so quickly detected. More than this, he had the privilege of-removing the corn, even before lie paid for it: and we kept it on board those many days for his accommodation. And yet more: we could have unloaded the corn at once and sold doubtless to a dozen other par- ties, and if any damage or tendency thereto had been then discovered, it would of course have been much less than it was, and the loss only been trifling at most. Take it altogether, to my mind it's a clear case that to the buyer f of this corn - the circumstances being such as they are - belongs all the loss; and as he agrees to abide our decision, he 'll get it, that is, if Mr. Wilson accepts my views about the matter." So Mr. Wilson's "two guarantees'  were correct. For Mr. Leonard not only gave a   92     HOW BENVNIE DID IT. very different decision from Bennie's, but in the letter which he wrote he went all over the case just as we-have heard him stating it to himself. More than a page of full size letter paper was thus occupied, which when handed to Mr. Wilson occasioned that gentleman an involuntary smile. "You've sifted the case pretty thoroughly, MY Leonard," said he; "I don't know that a lawyer could have done it more so, that is so far as our side is concerned." And then he put on a kind of comical expression which rather surprised Mr. Leonard, as that gentleman had not yet got it into his head that there could be any other side to it. "Yes, sir," was his reply; d"our customer evidently thinks he has a right to make recla- mation, or he would not have made it. The one 'word NO is all that I would think necessary to reply to his demand, so far as right is con- cerned; but as a matter of courtesy, it is of course proper that we give our ideas in full." "Well, Mr. Leonard," answered Mr. Wilson,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      93  you know that I have great confidence in your general views of commercial transactions, as well as your integrity, for I certainly do not think that you would willingly consent to wrong any. But what do you think of this settlement of the matter?"and he handed him a copy of Bennie's letter, written by himself word for word as Bennie had expressed it. "It's short," said the clerk with a shrug. ,' And sweet, can 'tjou add, Mr. Leonard?" "I think the buyer of the corn will say so, ifl I do n't," answered he. i     "Are you really very much surprised, Mr. Leonard, that I have decided the case thus?" "I must say that I m," replied the clerk; "in fact such a settlement as you instruct hardly entered my head as being in t ilWight- est degree admissible." "But you probably thought at least of' com- promising, even if you would not refund in full, did n't you?" "From your manner when you handed me the letter," said Mr. Leonard, "I inferred that   "    HOW BENNXIE DID IT. you thought of a compromise, which of course caused me to debate the case more in my own mind than I think I would possibly other- wise have done. That the purchaser, as we may infer, either demanded or hoped that there should be a full return made him is to me no satisfactory reason that it should be so. Thousands of men there are who will demand, and take, too, the last farthing they can draw, under any circumstances, without refer- ence to the right  or wrong  of the case; and this affair is only a fair illustration, that is in my opinion, of the truth of what I say. "Well, Mr. Leonard," replied Mr. Wilson, "I doubt not that you are entirely honest in your opinion, and it is not often that you and I have differed in the very many cases more or less of this kind, which we have, been compelled to work through. I believe, how- ever, that you will think differently concerning the present one when you will have thought longer. My mind is made up that I am doing right, or in other words, doing just as I think I   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      95 would want to be done by, were I in the position of our purchaser and he in mine." Mr. Leonard had nothing more to say, and returned to his office. Had he known who was the, author of the letter which had given him so much surprise, he would no doubt have been not only annoyed but provoked. But Mr. Wil- son kept that part to himself. Bennie returned to the office soon after Mr. Leonard had left it; and for a moment or two after his return he felt quite uneasy, as he imagined that Mr. Wilson seemed to give him rather a dissatisfied look as he passed to his desk. This, however, was only in his imagina- tion, as the merchant was just then occupied with a very important correspondence that had reference to a matter, compared with which a "thousand sacks of corn " was but a trifle. He was not in a mood for half an hour or more for bestowing attention upon any one, as Bennie easily saw, as now and then some of his prominent clerks- would come to him for in- structions. So the boy busied himself with the   !   96     sOW BENNIE DID IT. "stock-list," endeavoring to stow away in his memory as much about grades, quantities, qual- ities, and prices as he could, doubting not that sooner or later all this would prove valuable information for him. But before the hour came for Mr. Wilson to leave his office, he made an opportunity for encouraging Bennie concerning his letter, giving 'him to understand that his opinions as to the right in the case were in accord with his own, and with the instructions on which the agent was directed to act. This was of course to Bennie no small amount of relief, and his heart beat more hopefully than it had done for the hour or two before. For the balance of the afternoon he had the office much of the time to himself, and found occupa- tion in looking over a large invoice book which Mr. Wilson had had brought for his use. This was to him a sort of commercial text-book, from which very much was to be learned not only of prices, but of the comparative values of various articles of merchandise at different dates. And thus passed the first day of Bennie's experience   EOW BENNIE DID IT.      97 on the great highway towards becoming "a business man." e   *   s   *   * For several days there was no material change in the character of Bennie's occupa- tion. Occasionally Mr. Wilson would turn from his own engagements to have a pleasant word- or two, or to impart some piece- of infor- mation to his young employee in connection with whatever item of business was on hand. And by degrees there was woven into Bennie's work more or less of out-door duty, which, while it was strictly business, it was at the same time pleasant relief from the confinement of the office, usually so irksome to a bov. Among other features of this errand service, the cashier, by Mr. Wilson's request, frequently detailed Bennie for the purpose of making the deposits of moneys and drafts in bank. This Bennie liked, for it was at once a very respon- sible service, the deposits being always large, and brought him into that kind of business l association which was pleasant and advantage- ()us.   98    HOW BENNIE DID IT. He had just returned one day from the bank, and had- of course deposited the greater part of the funds that had been in the house, when a customer came to the cashier's desk to settle for a purchase of several hundred dollars' worth of flour. The amount to be paid was about six- teen hundred and fifty dollars, and in payment the purchaser presented a draft on one of the banks in the city for two thousand dollars. The change therefore due him, supposing that his draft was to be accepted as money, was about three hundred and fifty dollars. "I have just made my deposits," said the cashier to the purchaser, " and will have to give you our check for the change." "But I am just about leaving the city," re. plied the gentleman, " and as I can't make the check serviceable, I will of course need the change- in money." "Very well,' answered the cashier; " please take a seat for a few moments, and I will send out and- draw the money for you." And the cashier called Bennie in haste to go to bank and draw the money for the check.   .   HOCW BETNIE DID IT.     99 It was not much more than the work of a moment for the paying teller at the bank to- hand out the three hundred and fifty dollars to Bennie, which was done in bills mostly of the denominations of'" tens " and'" twenties." And S.   as Bennie was in haste, and himself closely no- ticed the teller's counting of the money, he did not think it necessary to go over it, but quickly placing it in his collection book, he hastily re- turned to the office. What was his surprise, when the money was counted by the cashier, to hear that gentleman say, "Benjamin, there is a mistake in the counting of this money!" In a moment Bennie's face showed the anxi- ety which this announcement occasioned him. This the cashier quickly noticed, and to Ben- nie's unspeakable relief, he said, "It is a mistake, however, which need give you but little trouble, as it is in our favor. The teller instead of giving you too little has paid you twenty dollars too much I Did you count the money at the bank?"   100    H6Ow BENNIE DID IT. "No, sir," replied Bennie, with a rising feel- ing of apprehension that he should have beenso remiss. The cashier was a man of kind heart; and, as this was the first time that he had sent Bennie to bank to draw money, he felt that the boy did not merit reproof for negligence. "Hereafter, Bennie," said he, "you must always be very careful to count money that may be paid you at bank or anywhere else, and to do so, too, in the presence of the person from whom you receive it. In so doing, errors can be corrected at once and without difficulty. You have, of course, noticed the cards in the banks, 'no mistakes corrected after parties hlave left the counter,' and you may well suppose the unpleasantness that you would have experienced had this twenty dollars been short instead of over." This "unpleasantness "had in fact already been gone over in Bennie's mind, causiing a sort of sickening sensation at the very thought, that the deficiency might have been charged to   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     10 10  his integrity instead of his carelessness. The latter would have been bad enough, but that he might have been considered dishonest, this he felt would have been dreadful.  In the mean time, while he was thus thinking, the customer had received his three hundred and fifty dollars from the cashier and had left the office.  Bennie was roused from his reverie by the cashier saying to him, "You have made a fair afternoon's work." '  "How, sir?" asked he with considerable surprise. "How I why you have made twenty dollars by the operation." Bennie's expression of astonishment made the cashier smile. "I cannot in the remotest degree understand how I have made twenty dollars," was his re- ply. "The monej does not belong to me." "To whom, then, does it belong?" asked the cashier with feigned astonishment; ,does not the balnk tell you by its card that it does not  correct mistakes?" "The bank may have its reasons, and very   102    HOW BENNIE DID IT. proper ones, too," answered Bennie, "for not proposing to refund money to every one who would go out and return to report that they had received too little; but when the report is made the other way, I hardly think that either the teller or the bank would refuse to receive the money." "But you know, my boy, there is an old adage which says, 'it's a poor rule that wont work both ways'; and if the bank persistently acts only on her own terms on one side, is it anything more than proper that you and 'I should just as persistently act on our terms when the transaction is in our favor?" "You and I, Mr. Watson," answered Bennie decidedly but respectfully, " aie responsible for the right and wrong of our own actions and not for those of a bank." "Certainly, we are," replied Mr. Watson. talking as though he was doing so more to stimulate argument than because he felt secure in the position he was assuming; "but don't 'circumstances alter cases?'"   : .eYO"  BENNIE DID IT.  10 "I expect they do," said Bennie with a smile but I do n't think they alter the ownership of these twenty 'dollars." "Let me make a suggestion," continued the cashier; " which is, that you return to the bank, tell the clerk that on returning here you found an error in your cash of twenty dollars, and ask him if he will please rectify the mistake. If you do so, my opinion is, that the only reply -you will receive will be a short metre calling of your attention to the very emphatic card of which we have been talking." "But I propose to save the teller's feelings," answered Bennie, shortly. The cashier laughed outright. "Save his feelings!" said he; "what do you mean  by that?" "I mean that if I were to subject him to doing what you suggest, it would only be making for him that unhappiness which he would be compelled to feel in giving me  a short answer. But if, on the other hand, I at once hand him the twenty dollars, with the *   104    HOW BENNIE DID IT. remark that he had by mistake overpaid a check by that much, the act would make upon him a softening and pleasurable- impression; and more than this, he would probably feel like listening with more attention to the next person who might need to make a report on the opposite side of the question." "And so you propose teaching our teller that there can be courtesy as well as business at his counter, do you?" "No, sir; " replied Bennie; "I propose doing nothing but my duty, which is to return him his money. Nevertheless, I think hat in doing so promfptly and pleasantly I may dhim and the bank too a kindness by inducing them to give a courteous attention to everybody who may have occasion to report mistakes." "Very well, my young preacher," replied the cashier, handing Bennie the twenty dollar bill; "here is your money, do with it as you please. But I assure you that a great many boys, and men, top, would take the bank on its own rules, and keep the money."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     105 "All of which may be true, Mr. Watson," said Bennie; "but yet, in my humble opinion, they would be doing wrong, while my pur- pose is to do what I believe to be right. With your permission, I will return: to the bank before it is closed." "Certainly, go on; and let me know   on your return how you were received." So Bennie returned with all haste -to the ,bank. But just as he was passing out of the cashier's door, Mr Wilson entered. "That boy is built upon a good foundation, Mr. Wilson," said the cashier, pointing to Bennie who was speedily stepping for the street. "So I think, Mr. Watson," replied Mr. Wil- son, pleasantly; "but what has occurred to induce your remark just now?'" The cashier narrated the whole affair, and in, doing so did Bennie the fullest justice as to the, emphatic manner with which in all the conver- sation he had declared his purpose of returning the money. And we too must do the cashier   106    HOW BENNIE DID IT. justice in stating that he was a man whose genuine principle would not have permitted him in this transaction to have done anything else except just what had been done by Bennie. The whole of his argument was simply forced, and for the purpose of gratifying his curiosity as to what would be the boy's views and procedure in the case. And it was with no small degree of pleasure that he listened to Bennie's firm expressions of honor and honesty, and his unalterable purpose, uninfluenced by what others might think or do, to pursue but the one course. "Principle," said Mr. Watson, " is evidently his spring of action, and not circumstances. And he seems to reason with a far-reaching perception into all the influences and results that may 'have connection with a given action. While one person, or a thousand persons, as it seems to me, might intuitively have felt just as he does in this present case, so far merely as to who was the rightful owner of the money, he evidently looks far. beyond this   ':!fl       ^HOW BENNIE DID IT.     107 point even to a train of moral results to all who in- any way may have connection with the matter." "Indeed, I agree with you, Mr. Watson," replied the merchant, "in what you say con- cerning him. There have already been many instances since he has been with us in which I have as it were incidentally drawn from him opinions, more particularly I mean in questions of morals, which would have been creditable to both the judgment and heart of a doctor of di- vinity. It must be that his parents have made very special efforts to implant within him the seeds of truth and righteousness." "Do you attribute such a character to paren- tal training, Mr. Wilson?" asked the cashier respectfully; , it seems to me that he is yet too young for such development unless it were more or less natural to him." "That there is a very great difference in the natural intent and principle to be found in hu- man nature as exhibited in one person comrn. pared with another," replied Mr. Wilson, " there  108    HOW BENNIE DID IT. can be no doubt; and I presume it is the fact, that there is a great degree of high-toned prin- ciple in Benjamin naturally. At the same time I do not doubt that there has been unusual atten. tion and earnest training bestowed upon him by his parents in the shaping and giving of Inethod to his motives and actions, so that without being either fanatical or morbid he has a quick and healthy perception of what right is, and what it is not " "Probably you are correct, sir," said Mr. Watson, "and with such a view of the case, what an immense responsibility there is on parents that they should be always diligent in the training of their children." "True enough," answered Mr. Wilson, with a shrug; "but I fear there is a wide spread deficiency on this point. For really it seems to me as though great numbers of parents ex- haust all the efforts that they do put forth with and for their children in teaching them or having them taught only that which will make them well to do in the world, in the light   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     109 through which the world looks at what well to do is.'" In the mean time, while the gentlemen were thus conversing, Bennie had presented himself at the teller's counter. This latter personage was a man somewhere between twenty-five and thirty years of age, had been several years in his present position, and was considered a cor- rect and efficient clerk; in his deportment, how- ever, towards all who had business with him, lle- was quick, decided, and arbitrary. Conse- quently, though he was held in high regard as a teller, he was unpopular as a man. He was, rapidly despatching business with his customers, when it became Bennie's turn to'have atten- tion. "You gave me this twenty dollars too much in the payment of a check half an hour or so past," said a very pleasant voice. The quick and peculiar change that occurred in the expression of the teller's face was almost ludicrous. A smile from him was a rarity, and you might have thought in noticing his undis.    "O    HOW BENiIE DID fT, turbed gravity and dignity from day to day that he felt that his position was as important as the keystone of a nation. But now he smiled I his face really brightened with a gleam of sun- shine, and the half dozen or more other clerks and business men who were beside Bennie, waiting their turn, almost felt that a new era had opened at the counter of the paying teller. And it was evident, too, from his extended hand, to take the money, that notwithstanding the "card," there  could  be circumstances. in which he, at least, if not the bank, did rectify mistakes. It was rather amusing to hear the remarks made by one and another of those who were standing near and witnessed the transaction. "That card of yours is too short, Mr. Teller," said one. "How so?" asked the teller with unusual pleasantness, notwithstanding he appeared in a rather crest-fallen condition. "Because it needs a  few more words on it." "What words?" 3sl$'       *   i 'Well, it, ought to read,' no mistakes cor- rected after parties have left the counter, unless the correction is in the bank's favor.'" "'Banks have as much human nater in 'em as anybody else," said a plain, common-sense look- ing man, dryly. "Yes," said a third, "it's the old spelling- book story of the ox and the bull after all." "What story is that?" asked another with pretended ignorance, in his- anxiety that the matter should be thoroughly " aired." "Well," was the reply, "the gist of it is, that, it makes a great difference in the way we see A  things when my bull gores your ox, or your ox gores my bull." "What check was it on which I overpaid L  you?" asked the teller, of Bennipe; for the poor I  fellow not only had his business to attend to, but was taking no special pleasure in the con- versation then going on. "George Wilson's check for three hundred and- fifty dollars," replied Bennie. The : was a fine lookg old gentleman who *    "2    HOW BENNIE DID IT. had been standing behind the counter, near the teller, during all this transaction, but who as yet had said nothing. Just as the teller stepped to the little counter where he had filed the check, this old gentleman spoke to Bennie, very kindly. , "Did you count your money, my son, before you left the bank?" asked he. "No,- sir," answered Bennie, most frankly, "and I probably did wrong in not then counting it; but to tell the truth, though I frequently make the deposits of the house, this is the first check which I have been sent to draw. I was in a great hurry, too, and as I noticed the teller counting the money, it seemed to me cor- rect, and I did not think there was any neces- sity that I should go over it." "Where did you discover the mistake?" ' Not until the money "was counted by our cashier." '  "And why did you return the surplus?" "Sir?" asked Bennie, with an expression of surprise that was almost like consideriif even the question an insult.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     113 "Why did you return the surplus?" repeated the gentleman, himself also experiencing some surprise at Bennie's expressive manner; "might it not have been entirely proper for you to keep it, on the basis of this card?" "No, sir," answered Bennie, most emphati- cally, yet without anything in his manner that was impertinent. "And why?" "Because, sir, my ideas of such matters are based upon a card which I think puts them in a different and much better light." The old gentleman felt his interest -in the boy rising very decidedly. And in fact the little crowd which had been increasing during this momentary interruption of business was grow- ing interested too. "And will you please inform us what your card is?" asked the old gentleman. "It reads thus, sir, ' Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,'" replied Bennie. And:s he went forward from one word to 8   "4 ,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.- another in reciting the instructions of his 'card,' there was an increasing and most marked attention given by all who heard him. "Do you expect, my son," once more in- quired the old gentleman, 'always in this world to be able to go by that card?" "I intend to try, sir." Bennie made a move- ment to leave, but the gentleman stopped him. it I would like to ask your name, my son." "BENJAMN STOUT, sir*" "And are you in the employ of Mr. George Wilson?" ,' Yes, sir." "I will not detain you longer," said the old gentleman, and Bennie withdrew. But among all who stood by the counter, on its either side there was not one whose eyes were turned from the boy until he had left the bank. Truly enough might Mr. Wilson's cashier then have said ao,-Bennie, "You have made a fair afternoon's work of it"; for the boy had preached a sermon not soon to be forgotten by any who heard Lim. r     +    tlLUtl   BO W BENIE V DID IT.    115 When Bennie re-entered the cashier's office, Mr. Wilson was still there; and his presence was no small embarrassment to the boy, whose modesty was such that he did not like to be called on to relate the incidents of the half hour just passed. It was easy enough, however, for him to see that the cashier had told Mr. Wilson of the affair, and that both gentlemen were interested to hear the result of his visit touthe bank. "Well, Benjamin," asked the cashier, "did you bring back your twenty dollars?" "No, sir." "The teller certainly did not take it, did he?" asked Mr. Watson with feigned sur- prise. "Yes, sir." "Ah hah, he did, eh? then they do sometimes correct mistakes there after alll Did he exhibit any very special reluctance to taking the money?" "No, sir; not the least." "X he thank you?"   "6    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Yes, sir," replied Bennie, " he did. and was much pleasanter with me than ever before. And I am inclined to believe that if I should ever have occasion to go to him and report that there was an error against himself lihe would be disposed to give me at least a respectful hearing, and probably make good the' deficiency." "Well, if you have accomplished that much so. far as his -treatment of you is concerned," replied the cashier, "it may, I think, be' hoped that you have done him some good in general." "Don't you suppose, Mr. Watson," asked Bennie, "that the teller only acts as he is instructed by the cashier?" "Very likely he does,"   answered Mr. Watson, "so far as not proposing to correct mistakes is concerned, although the present instance shows that even in this matter his action is discretionary; but in the manner of his doing, it would be well for himself and the bank too were he to be more courteous.":-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     117 Mr. Wilson had been a greatly interested listener. The transaction just related had not shaped, but simply strengthened his opinion as already shaped, of the true-hearted boy before him. Bennie's position in the matter was only what Mr. Wilson would have expected. The merchant, however, made as it were but a pas- sing remark of approval, for he knew well that, any fulsome praise would be distasteful to the boy, and would accomplish no good. Indeed, Bennie's evident anxiety was to say as little about the matter as possible, especially with reference to himself; for as quickly as he could he went out to other engagements, and with a sensible feeling of relief. \   CHAPTER VI. THE "OLD GENTTEMANX" of whom we spoke in our last chapter was the President of the bank. His name was PETTIS. Not many days after the affair of the twenty dollars, he took i occasion to visit Mr. Wilson, not at that gentle- man's office, but at his room. Mr. Pettis had become much interested in Bennie on the day he had seen him in the bank, and being a mnan whose benevolent character made him ever watchful for opportunities for doing good, he had determined to make an early opportunity for knowing all about the youth, his circumstan- ces, and his prospects. He and Mr. Wilson were old friends; and while Mr. Pettis well knew that in the hands of his friend the boy would have great advantages, and would doubt- less do well, he had yet to learn what would   HOW BENNIE DID It.    119 interest him much more, even the peculiar esti- mation in which Bennie was already held: and when he learned who the father was, he was both astonished and pleased. "I have never had any personal acquaintance with Mr. Stout," said he, "but in a busi- ness way have known of him in days gone by. And to tell the truth, after he had made a failure and passed out, as he- has, of the ordinary mercantile drift, I have lost sight of him, and about forgotten that such a man lived. Indeed, I somehow had received the impression that his failure was disreputable; consequently I felt the less interest in preserv- ing any recollection of him." "I, too, had gotten the same idea as to the character of Mr. Stout's failure," replied "Mr. Wilson; "buit our friend Norton-, knows all about him and his affairs, and has assured me, that there is not only no reason for such a rumor, but that the man is entirely above fraud. And I may say, that were I disposed to doubt this the remarkably high-toned sense of principle   120    BOW BENNIE DID IT. and honor in the son would dispose me to be slow in accepting any charges unfavorable to the father." "Then," said Mr. Pettis earnestly, " the sum- ming up of the whole matter is, that we have a worthy, though unfortunate man among us whom we have not had the generosity to take by the hand and place upon his feet." For a moment Mr. Wilson seemed as though he thought this was rather a reproachful thrust aimed at himself. But this feeling passed away almost as quickly as it came, and in a few words he acquainted his friend with Mr. Stout's condition, and his unwillingness to embark in business on his own account while his health remained as it was. "Is his health such," asked Mr. Pettis, " as to prevent him from engaging in any business?" "He has been improving in health for the past two or three months," answered Mr. Wil  I son, "and if he could have a situation in which the responsibility of business on his own ac- count would not be devolved upon him, he   tIOW BENNIE DID IT.    121 doubtless would yet be a-useful and efficient man. Indeed, it is but a few days since Benja- min said that his father was speaking of his improved health, and was expressing the hope that some door might be opened whereby he might be serviceable to his family." "Can it be true, think you, friend Wilson, that the family is really in needy circumstan- ces?"  "I am inclined to think they would be were it not for temporary assistance that is rendered by one friend and another until the father could once more be well enough for business." As Mr. Wilson said this, there was a softening in the expression of Mr. Pettis' countenance, for the thought came to his mind that among these "friends " who had been thus quietly assisting the family, one was probably not very far off. So for a moment or two he sat absorbed in thought, meditating as to what he could suggest that mightt be of service in the case. And very soon his face brightened up, showing that an ;!   122    HOW BENNIF DID IT. idea had come to him which had in it much of hope. "At first, friend Wilson," said he, "I was thinking whether it might not be probable that in such a house as, yours, there could not be an opening made for Mr. Stout; but you of course have thought that point over and decided it /before now. I have, however, another sugges- tion. The cashier of our bank, Mr. Ainsworth, expects to resign his office in a few days, or at any rate not longer than a month hence. If we can ascertain that Mr. Stout is a capable man for the place, why could we not secure his elec. tion?" Mr. Wilson's eyes fairly- sparkled with de- light when this suggestion was made. "A happy thought," said he, straightening himself up with the air of a man full of purpose, "and one which we must try and accomplish. You are correct, Mr. Pettis, in supposing that I have thought over the matter i of making an opening for Mr. Stout in my   HOW BENNIE DID. IT.     123 house. In, the first place, however, our busi- ness is of that kind that in his present health there is no place he could well fill, unless it were some one already occupied by tried and trusty men; men too, some of them, who need the places as much as he.  More than this, as the son is already with me, there are reasons why I think it would be better for the father, the boy, and myself that Mr. Stout should be occupied elsewhere.     The office which you propose would certainly be aE most desirable one for him, and it could not be otherwise than comfortable to the stockholders to know that a man of such integrity was in the place. And surely from the fact that our friend Norton and myself are in the directory, we may hope that an important step is already made towards accomplishing the matter." Mr. Pettis was delighted.   And who can there be that is not always delighted when doing good?  We    have often heard and read of the "luxury" of such work, and such indeed it is. But how little do we think of the great  124    HOWTr B EiLNIE DID IT. blessing thpat is conferred on us when placed where we may benefit others I Self, unhappily, absorbs too much of our care and labor, and in the blind infatuation so common to human nature we fail to see the true sources from which this self might draw the sweetest plea- sures. How  little do we appreciate the blessed purpose of our Saviour when he said, "A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another." , "Why may we not see Mr. Norton this evening?" asked Mr. Pettis, almost impa- tiently. "There are some among our directors who know of Mr. Ainsworth's expected resigna. tion; and while I would not improperly inter- fere to the hindering of ally good  man obtaining the place, it might be nevertheless that some one might get it whose necessities are not like those of Mr. Stout." "I will go with you at once," replied Mr. 'x is; and in a few minutes the gentlemen were on the way to Mr. Norton's house. The Christian hearted lawyer was somewhat   OW- BEXNIE DID IT.     125 surprised when he ascertained who his visitors were. In the first place, he could not imagine why they should have come togethier, as he had never thus had a visit from them; and in addi. tion to this, he wondered what could have brought them at so late an hour in the evening. Nevertheless, they received from him a most cordial welcome. " We knew    you  would     think   we  are making an unseasonable visit," said Mr. Pettis; "but we were certain that as soon as you learned the object of it, you would decide that it is one of those mo.ins which are always in order."  "I am indeed a little surprised by your visit," said Mr. Norton, " but I assure you I am not the less happy to see you." "So far as my part in our visit is concerned friend Norton," replied Mr. Wilson, "you may consider yourself as having whatever of blame or credit there is connected with it; for you be.    126    WOW BENNIE. DID IT. gan the work which we are here with a propo- sition to continue." Mr. Norton was of course in the dark as much as ever, and showed, too, that he was, by his look of surprise. But somehow -he im- agined that the visit had something to do with Bennie; and for a moment, too, he experienced a rising of apprehension lest what they had to communicate might be something which it would be unpleasant for him to hear. "Our errand relates to Mr. Stout," continued Mr. Wilson, whose countenance seemed so beaming with something hopeful that lMr. Norton's apprehensions very soon subsided. it What would you think of his being made cashier of the Merchants' Bank?" The question was put as it were so bluntly, and took Mr. Norton so entirely by surprise that he fairly sprang from his chair. "Good, good, good," cried he, rubbing his hands with delight; "the very thing, the right   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     127 man in the right place. In all my 'hundred and one' imaginings for poor Stout, how is it that I never thought of this?" His enthusi- asm and pleasure were so great as to cause his visitors no little satisfaction. "You knew, then," said Mr. Pettis, "of ]Mr. Ainsworth's intended resignation?" "Yes, and this it is which so greatly sur- prises me, that anxious and watchful as I have been for an opening for Mr. Stout, especially during the few weeks past, in which he has been so rapidly improving in health, I did not immediately think of this position for him I " "It is hardly necessary, then, Mr. Norton," said Mr. Wilson, " for us to ask if you consider him a proper man for the place?" The lawyer's decided reply settled this point, quick enough, so far as his opinion of the man was concerned. "' There is this feature, however," said he, "about which I am probably not entirely com- petent to speak. The cashier of a bank must necessarily have either a considerable experience   HOW BENNIE DID IT. with banking operations, as well as a good acquaintance in the commercial circles where he is, to make him an efficient man in his office, or he ought to have a quick and intuitive per- ception in financial operations. Now, as to this part of the question, my judgment, or at least my information, is hardly such as it would be judicious to accept.  However, before one o'clock to-morrow, Providence permitting, I can be enlightened concerning the matter from sub- stantial and knowing parties, and will let you know. But even supposing that all the infor- mation we may get proves satisfactory, do you think we can secure his election? " "Of that we cannot of course say with certainty," replied Mr. Pettis; "but the pros- pect ought to be considered hopeful, with the influence that the three here present can exert in his favor." "True enough," said Mr. Norton; "and if there ever was a case, in my opinion, where we may consider our efforts as worthily bestowed, this is one. It is to be feared that good men,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.         129 such as Mr. Stout, are too often neglected when misfortune comes upon them, and so sink into despondency and want. Well would it be for us all were we to exercise a part of our daily anxieties in behalf of the needy around us, for we doubtless would not only be doing good service to a worthy object, but might re-establish in the general social machin- ery a feature that would help it work to better advantage." The gentlemen separated that evening, each enjoying his proportion of the "luxury" of which we spoke awhile ago, and all full of their own plans for bringing about the object they had been discussing. Before Mr. Norton's accustomed hour for being in his office, he was the next morning on his way to make an early visit to a gentleman whom he knew could give him the information which he wanted concerning Mr. Stout. "You know more of his capacity for this position, Mr. Lewis, than I,' said fr. Norton, after making that gentleman acquainted with  130     HOW BENNIE DID IT. the object of his visit; "what. would you say concerning his fitness for it?" I know this," answered Mr. Lewis, "that he and I were together in the directory of the Ocean Bank, prior to his failure, and the remark was often. made in my hearing that he was eminently fitted for a financier, and had , qualities and tastes which would adapt him better for such occupation than for a mer- chant." ," Then might it not be considered singular that he should not have so managed his affairs as to prevent failure?" asked Mr. Norton "In one sense, yes, replied Mr. Lewis; " but Ais was one of the kinds of failure which at times come not only to individual concerns but also to banks and other moneyed institutions. It not unfrequently occurs, so closely connected is some special commercial drift, that where financial calamity has befallen one of. the con- nections, all the balance sooner or later topple with it. And this was Mr. Stout's condition. But in the settlement of his affairs, le made   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     131 for himself a reputation for candor and honor that would be a recommendation to the highest trust." "Surely," thought Mr. Norton, as he wended his way to his office, , we have much to hope for in our case; and' I can easily imagine the hap- piness that will be experienced by friend Stout and his family, if we are successful. By the way, would it not be a good plan if I were to walk over- and let them know that the project is On foot? Probably, however, it would bel better that we say nothing to them, of it at present, as in case of failure the disappoint. ment would be great." Thus soliloquizing, he kept on his way and was soon in his office. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the trio of the preceding evening were in Mr. Pettis' pri- vate room, according to engagement, to hear Mr. Norton's report. "I feel very confident," said Mr. Pettis, u from your looks, that you are prepared to give us encouraging news." "I certainly am," was the reply, "and can   132     IO W BENNIE DID IT.  make a report even more favorable than Ihad i thought; for we can produce a special recom- mendation for Mr. Stout, not only on a general  business basis, but with reference to the very v position in which we propose to place him. I have this morning been with a gentleman who was formerly with him in the Board of Direc-  tors of the Ocean Bank, who informs me that   ; Mr. Stout's financial capacity and adaptation w re the subject of commendable remark in the   : d rectory; and this friend is decidedly of the opinion that our bank would not only be doing Mr. Stout a benefit in giving him the office, but would be conferring a benefit upon itself." , Encouraging, indeed," said Mr. Wilson.  j "Yes, yes," added Mr. Pettis, "and seem-  ingly providential. We may surely feel that we have a good foundation on which to build.  j Doubtless neither of us has thought of Mr. Stout as being supierior to other men whom we might elect, our thoughts being so much occu- pied with his interests; but if we do succeed in his election, and he proves such, we will cer-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      133 :ainly have double cause for thankfulness in the ;aMse."- "By the way," said Mr. Wilson, " in the light )f the information which we have concerning ,r. Stout, will it not be better in presenting his lomination to the directory to take strong ground, that is, to urge his qualifications and lot his necessities?" "By all means," replied Mr. Pettis; " we can lo this conscientiously, and it will surely be the aost effective way."       M "Let me see," said Mr. Norton, " it is so long ince we have had an election for a cashier that I ave about forgotten what number of votes is ecessary; is it a majority or a three-fourths   !. ote?"                        "Three-fourths," replied Mr. Pettis; " and  our Board is composed of twelve gentlemen, e must have of course six in addition to our-  l]ves."  Being thoroughly in earnest in their purpose, iese three benevolent men put themselves ener- 3tically to the work of" canvassing " among *  :: *   HOW BENNIE DID IT. the other members of the Board in Mr. Stout's behalf. They took the names one by one of their nine associates, and according as it was deemed best, divided them out, each agreeing to exert his influence as far as practicable with those assigned to him; and all were to report at an early day agreed upon as to the position and prospects. It may be that the young reader, especially, who may have this history in   hand, may think that all this way of doing the thing, by these three gentlemen, was entirely unneces- sary. But this would be a mistaken idea; for in the first place, the office of cashier of the Merchants Bank of Q  - was a very desirable position; and then the probabilities were, that as soon as it should be generally known that it was to be vacant, there would doubtless not only.be many who would make effort to obtain it, but who would also have friends among the Board of Directors to whom they would apply to aid them. This, of course, these three gentlemen well knew; hence the   systematic manner in which they went to work. Within two  hours after they separated, that morning, Mr. Norton entered the counting- room of a Mr. ELLSLIE, a' merchant of high standing and a member of the Merchants Bank Directory.  With him  Mr. Norton had not been very intimate, although in certain law matters Mr. Ellslie had employed Mr. Norton as his counsel; nevertheless, he was as much so as were either Mr. Pettis or Mr. Wilson, and was consequently deemed the proper one to see him. There was one thing which Mr. Norton certainly knew, namely, that his client was a man of peculiar mould, strong in his likes and dislikes, and decidedly  "set in his- way." Therefore it was necessary to " engineer " him a little, or as military men would say, to "come at him by gradual approaches."  The subject of the cashiership was introduced by degrees. When3   r. Norton  thought he had reached an appropriate point in the conversation, he remarked quietly:   134 136    HOW BENNiIE DID IT. "There is a probability, I understand, that we are soon to select a new cashier." J So I hear," replied Mr. Ellslie, " and as it is very important that we obtain the right kind pf a man, I have been casting about as to where we may obtain the one we want." , Have you any yet in view?" asked Mr. Norton. "Yes, I might say that I have thought of a dozen who would be good, but our endeavor, of course, must be to obtain the best." "Well," said Mr. Norton with a smile, "in that you are entirely correct. Have you such an one in mind?" "No," replied Mr. Ellslie, "I have not yet fixed upon one who would be the man whom I would like to see put in the office. But have you any one in view?" "Yes, I have one whom I think would make a most admirable man for the place, and who would doubtless devote himself to it with an earnest and increasing interest." "Who is he?" asked Mr. Ellslie, quickly.   tItOW BENNIE DID IT.    137 "MR. WYLYS STOUT," replied Mr. Norton. The merchant dropped his head, and his face showed intense dissatisfaction. "You know him; of course," said Mr. Nor- ton, nothing daunted. "Yes," was the answer, made almost gruffly. "Would not his election suit you?" "No, sir." "Well, I will be glad to know your objec- tions," said Mr. Norton, very pleasantly; "for if he would not be the proper man, I certainly will not advocate his election any more than would you." "I have several objections, and strong ones too," replied the merchant almost bitterly, but without saying more. Mr. Norton made no reply, but quietly awaited what Mr. Ellshe had to say. "In the first place," said Mr. Ellslie, as soon as he got in the mood for speaking, "I do not think he has either the capacity or the acquaint- ance that would make him the valuable man for the place. This of course I say (and his tone A    138    HOW BENNIE DID IT. and manner just then assumed a more courte- ous aspect) with all due deference to yourself and the opinion you have just expressed con. cerning him." Mr. Norton felt at once that the merchant had placed himself at a disadvantage by his hasty manner, but with most affable address answered him, "I would not insist, Mr. Ellslie, that my judg- ment was the best in a case of this kind: there are certainly weighty reasons why a merchant of your large experience would be the better judge. At the same time, I think I have such testimony concerning Mr. Stout, which, unless you are influenced by personal considerations, would materially change the opinion you have expressed. But may I ask if you have addi- tional objections?" "Yes, I have," and his countenance again assumed its bitterness. "I would not be considered inquisitive, Mr. Ellslie," said Mr. Norton;, as he saw that the merchant hesitated about saying more; "-but   BOW  BEY n IE DD IT.    139 really I hope that you will let me have your opinions freely; for I repeat, that if there is any proper reason against Mi. Stout, I shall certainly do nothin g in favor of his election." It may be," replied Mr. Ellslie, "thatIam wrong in my estimate of Mr. Stout; but to be candid with you I dont consider im an onest man         I cnsider him an honest Mr. Norton was not only much surprised At this expression of opinion, but very plainly showed that he was.  With an  earnestness that might have been taken for anger, he demanded of Mr. Ellslie his reasons for mak- ing sucih a charge.  "1 lost by is failure," said Mr. Ellslie in a very decided tone.         - "Which may be true," remarked Mr. Norton "but what does that prove? When his affairs w  ere entirely arranged, your claim was paid in full, was it not?" "No, sir." "No I   " exclaimed Mr. Norton; " what defi- iency was there?"   "O    HOW BENNIE DID IT.           "Interest!" Mr. Norton could hardly restrain his risings i of contempt. Hie knew that Mr. Stout's credi- tors had received ' the face" of their claims, surrender ing all demands for " interest and damages "; and that to settle thus, everything, almost to home necessities, had been given up by Mr., Stout in order to accomplish the end. And furthermore, almost to a man, the creditors had, after a thorough investigation of his affairs, expressed themselves as being in the highest degree satisfied with him as a man  of honor, who had done everything in his power to wrong none. And now, that Mr. Ellslie should bring, up this pittance of interest as an oljection not only to assisting a needy man, but using it as a weapon with which to make a thrust at his integrity, was such an ungenerous i action that the lawyer had to make an effort to : restrain the outhurst of what he felt. Never- theless, for the sake of the man for whom he was pleading, he spake again without any betrayal of his feelings.   HzOW BENNIE DID IT.    141 "Well," said he, "Mr. Ellslie, 'tis true &hat was something. It would certainly have been nothing more than right that you should have received interest on your claim, waiting as long as you all did. And I have no doubt that as soon as Mr. Stout finds himself able to pay your claim of interest, he will promptly md cheerfully do so. Intimately acquainted Is I was with all the circumstances connected vith his failure, I have the fullest confidence hat everything he had was surrendered for the enefit of his creditors, and in fact, that he put ven his family into most straitened condition,  -  hat his debts might  be paid.

But just now ere are two things for you to consider:       st, such a  charge as you make, if circulated, : d believed, is of course ruinous to his       aracter; and second, regarding it as true,      l u  are thereby caused to withhold your vote   "2    ROW BENNIE DID IT. and your influence, where both might, ba most serviceable to a worthy man and worthy family. To be plain with you, Mr. Ellslie, I am here, not only as desiring that we should give Mr. Stout this officc, but as his personal friend; axed I trust that you will allow me to undeceive you in the opinion you entertain concerning him." A, I do not doubt, Mr. Norton," replied Mr. Ellslie, who had quietly heard the lawyer through, "that you believe all that you have said of Mr. Stout; and it is certainly true that he freely gave up his property for the benefit of his creditors, even including many house- hold effects: but notwithstanding this, there are some of us who have believed that lhe made a large reserve of actual cash, more tfan was necessary for immediate family necessities, and with which he might have discharged the last cent of his obligations." To this, Mr. Norton only replied with an in- credulous smile. "You were never much acquainted with Mr.   HOW BEN.-IE DID IT.  '  143 Stout, I presume, Mr. Ellslie," said he, after a little delay. No, .sir." "Nor do you know that the charge you thus bring is true; do you?" "Well, no; I can't say that I saw him take the money and appropriate it to his own use." "Can you name any one who did?" "No, sir."              -    "Will you please give me your reasons, une- quivocally, or those of any one else who be- lieves this of him, why they or you have come to such a conclusion?" "Well," said Ir. Ellslie, " e have thought that the general style of things appertaining to himself and farily seems to indicate abundance of money; and as he has not yet been engaged in business, it is but fair to presume that this indication has an ample foundation." There was a hard heartedness about Mr. Ellslie's speech and manner both that almost made Mr. Norton shudder; but he said nothing by w  which the merchant m ight know his feeling's !3'r  l   "4    HOW BEkNIE DID II or the struggle which it cost him to master them. , Mr. Ellslie," said he with the emlphasis of a man who felt that he must speak decidedly, "I know Mr. Stout's affairs entirely, and I know, beyond any mistake, whence his support has come since his failure." Mr. Ellslie gave Mr. Norton a look that was full of inquiry, but he asked nothing. ,' And more than this, if it is necessary, you can know, too." Yet the merchant verbally asked no ques- tion. But Mr. Norton saw plainly that hie was eager to hear, and would be glad enough to receive the information. , Shall I tell you what I know?" asked Mr. Norton, putting on a pleasant and commnlli- cative air. "I will be happy to have you do so, Mr. Norton, if there is no impropriety ia it," was the reply. "Friends," answered Air. Norton, "who have known his case entirely, have helped Mr. Stout   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     145 w ith the actual cash which you have thought he reserved; the necessity for this assistance, how- ever, has been somewhat diminished  since his son has been in the employ of Mr. Wilson." Mr. Ellslie's head dropped at this announce- ment, and his countenance exhibited no little surprise. "Mr. Norton," said he, "in this view of the case, I have been doing Mr. Stout injustice; and if I have, I promptly ask his pardon, and yours too, as his friend. I of course believe implicitly what you say of him and the whole matter, and shall feel relieved on my own account as well as his. As to the question, however, of elect- ing him as our cashier, I cannot now promise. While I will cheerfully do any thing that will be proper, as an amend for the wrong feelings which I have entertained towards him, as a director in the bank it would not be right simply on such a basis, for me to give him my vote." 10^X    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Certainly not," said Mr. Norton, " and I am certain -I would not have you do so." "This, however, I will promise," continued Mr. Ellslie; I will make such inquiry as will enable me to know intelligently concerning his capacity, from merchants who are judges, and if the report is favorable, he shall have my vote, and if he will accept it, my friendship, too."  Mr. Norton thanked him and retired. And as the lawyer walked away his heart was enjoy- ing another instalment of the " luxury" that to him was a "perpetual feast." "Truly," said he to himself, "does the Bible say, 'a soft answer turneth away wrath'; for had I yielded to my angry passions and spoken to Mr. Ellslie as they two or three times suggested, I would have lost my case. However, the result, even thus far, I have reason to be thankful for; and I am glad, too, that he has some magnanimity left, as evinced by his readiness to retrieve whatever he might have thought or done wrong."   There were two more gentlemen upon whom Mr. Norton had to call, both of whom were acquainted with Mr. Stout, one of them intimately. The latter was happy to know the nature of Mr. Norton's visit, and expressed himself as entirely in favor of the election. The other had a friend for whom he was anxious to obtain the place, and whose necessi- ties, he said, as well as his capacity, were fully equal to Mr. Stout's. For him, he felt it his duty to make every consistent effort; never- theless, he promised to urge nothing against Mr. Stout, and if he found it unlikely that his own candidate would secure the majority vote, he would then give his in favor of Mr. Stout. Thus Mr. Norton saw, that of the three with whom he was to make effort, two were as yet uncertain. Nevertheless, he felt confident that as matters now stood, he .had much to hope, comforted with which thought he turned his steps towards his office. In the mean time, Mr. Pettis and Mr. Wilson had not been idle in the matter. Of the three   "8    HOW BENNIE DID!IT. on whom Mr. Pettis was to call, one was a Mr. Strong, a very precise and methodical man, who made very little allowance for anything that to him seemed a wrong, no matter what the circumstances' under which, or who the person by whom it was committed. But while on this side of the question he appeared so void of charity, he was on the other hand prompt and loud in his acknowledgment and praises of right. He was a man of few words, had, generally a pretty clear understand- ing of what he was talking about, and what was said to him, and when he spoke, spoke  right out. , "We have to elect a new  cashier soon, Mr. Strong," said Mr. Pettis to him. "Yes," was the reply. "Have you any one in view?" "None." "May I suggest?"?              : "Certainly."  "Mr. WYLYS STOUT."             a "Do n't know him."                 HOW BENNIE DID IT.     149 "He is the father of the boy with whom you were so much pleased in connection with the return to the bank of that twenty dollar bill." "Is the boy a fair representative of the father?" "I can answer y%, without any hesitation," replied Mr. Pettis. "Nothing could be better, as far as it goes," said Mr. Strong; It but what do you know of the father in the other respects necessary to qualify him for the post?" "Much; and from   sources entitled to the fullest confidence, designating him :as not only one who may make us a passably good officer, but as one whose taste, experience, and capacity unite to form him  a desirable man for just such a position." "Very good; tell me all about him." And Mr. Pettis told " all about him." "He shall have my vote," said Mr. Strong when Mr. Pettis had concluded. "And indeed, I would do much for him,' he continued, for    ::  '   HOW BENNIE DID IT. the sake of that boy. It is not every day that we see such a boy as that, and when we do, he ought to understand, and so ought every other boy in the community, that character is valuable, and that principle is a king who may command at pleasure." "I thank you, Mr. Strong," said Mr. Pettis, as he rose to leave, "for the sake of the boy, the father, the family, and for myself." "And I thank you, Mr. Pettis, for giving me the information on which I shall cast my vote. And furthermore, if ever that boy wants a friend, which by the way cal hardly be pos- sible as long as he stands on his present foun- dation, send him to me." The gentlemen clasped hands, in which act they made a mutual compact which to Bennie Stout, "as long as he stood on his present foundations" was worth "thousands." After leaving Mr. Strong, Mr. Pettis went to the counting-room of Mr. MARK LACY, which gentleman after making as thorough inquiry con- cerning Mr. Stout as he could, and feeling satis-   fled in the case, added the promise of his vote to those already given; consequently Mr. Pettis was greatly encouraged with the prospect, and went on his way rejoicing. His last call was on a Mr. Isaac Sanford. But on this 0gen- tleman he seemed unable to make any impres- sion whatever in favor of Mr. Stout, against whom he had framed opinions and prejudices similar to those entertained by Mr. Ellslie. And in addition to this, he had a candidate of his own, with whom he seemed persistently determined to allow no other to be brought into competition. There was nothing, however, in his manner towards Mr. Pettis that was in any degree uncourteous; he was too much the gentleman, and had too much respect for Mr. Pettis, to deport himself other than as a gen- tleman should. In some respects it would probably have been better had Mr. Norton taken him on his list; for the lawyer's ex- perience in his profession capacitated him greatly more for dealing with men who need a certain, and proper amount of "engineering" to bring them steadily to a given point.  HBOW BENNIE DID IT. So Mr. Pettis didn't feel quite as agreeable at the moment of leaving Mr. Sanford as he, had felt when he came from his interview with the two former gentlemen. This, however, was but as a passing cloud, for his hope quickly revived, and he returned to his office in a very cheerful mood. , Mr. WILSON had also been faithfully doing his part of the work; but strange to say, although neither of the three gentlemen of his list was committed to any special candidate, nevertheless all, for reasons of their own, pre- ferred further investigation into the matter, and would make no promise as to their votes, at present. This much, however, Mr. Wilson had to encourage him, that while none of these gen- tlemen would give a committal in favor of Mr. Stout, there was not one who said he would not give him his vote. And so ended for that day the benevolent efforts of these three men,- men of such position and influence that if any- thing by such means could 'be accomplished in the case, they were certainly able to do it. Business of their own they had in abundance,   EOW BENNIE DID IT.   153   and of such character as to be continually needing their attention, but now they saw that self must be set aside awhile, and their " neigh- bor" considered; and promptly they threw them- selves into the work with that generosity of interest that always returns into the bosom of him who exercises it, -a rich and blessed re- ward.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.   CHAPTER VII. AD Mr. Stout and his family known the efforts which were now on foot in their behalf, they would of course have been greatly anxious as well as gratified; and it was well L that Mr. Norton refrained from communicating the matter to them, as it had occurred to him to do. Nevertheless, the whole family had been strong in faith that the God in whom they trusted was not only able to do, but surely would do for them that which, would be for good. But Mr. Stout's faith did not prevent him from putting forth effort. And as his health seemed now returning, he deemed it duty to make daily exertion, believing that in so doing he would be going in the way where the provi- dences of God would direct, and where occupa- tion would meet him. "Luck " and t chance"   were no features of his creed. He believed literally that the Hand which clothed the lily would certainly clothe him and his. Nevertheless, Mr. Stout did not meet with immediate success, and many days were to come and go from the time that he felt himself sufficiently able to engage in business before the success was to come. Still his faith did not fail; night gave him refreshing sleep, and with each returning morning hope shed upon him her refreshing light. Coming home one day at noon, he found the following note await- ing him: "Q---- Aug. 15, 18-. "MR. WYLYS STOUT: "Dear Sir:--If convenient, I will be happy to have you call upon me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. 'By so doing you will probably hear of something to your advantage. Respectfully, "WM. SMTH, "75 King street." When Mr. Stout had read this note, he handed it to his wife, and sat a little while   156    HO W BENNIE DID IT. endeavoring to bring to mind who this William Smith was and- what his business. The street was one on which much heavy business was done, and he thought he remembered having seen the name indicated, when he had now and A then been in that neighborhood. "I have no definite recollection about it," "said he to his wife; but of course I will call as requested, and if anything is awaiting me that is to be really to my advantage will accept it with a thankful heart." And while both himself and wife felt the earnest risings of gratitude for anything which looked like a hopeful prospect, neither of them was unduly elated. Whatever this was that Mr. Stout was to hear or receive, they felt that the providences connected with it would be such as would enable them to know whether it was to be accepted or rejected. "Advantage," in Mr. Stout's estimate, did not mean just what it did with everybody else;, so he knew the proper way:for him was to wait and see. Ben- nie could have told his father and mother all dlii   HOW B ENN IE DID' IT.   i57 about Mr. William Smith and his business, but for reasons of their own, the father and mother concluded to say nothing about the note to him until they had ascertained by personal applica. tion what it meant. Promptly at ten o'clock the next morning Mr. Stout was at the door of Mr. Smith. Looking at the sign he read thus: WTLTLTAM SMTH, Importer, and Wholesale Dealer FOREIGN AND DO3IESTIC LIQUORS. Passing in, Mr. Stout entered the counting- room and introduced himself to a gentleman there who he was informed was Mr. Smith, and who also introduced him to a friend sitting by, a Mr. Ellslie. "I have calledl upon you in accordance with the invitation herewith, said Mr. Stout, open- ing the note. And while he was about pre- senting it, Mr. Ellslie se as if to retire. But   158    HOW BENNIE DID IT. Mr. Smith laid his hand upon the shoulder of his friend and stayed him. "You need not go, friend Ellslie," said he; "my business with this gentleman is not such as to make it necessary, and I want to see you further concerning the matter of which we were talking." Whereupon Mr. Ellslie resumed his seat. What a pity, thought Mr. Stout as he ob- served the appearance and deportment of Mr. Smith, that :he should be engaged in such a business; for, so far as first impressions go, he seems to be a genuine gentleman. Which in- deed, as to Mr. Smith's general address, was but a correct judgment; for while in the view of Mr. Stout he was doing a business entirely ex- ceptionable, he was a man genteel and refined, though worldly to the last extent. Mr. Smith had heard of Mr. Stout's case and circumstances, and had sent for him to make a proposition for his services. But nothing could have been more graceful or courteous than was Mr. Smith's manner. j  as the farthest from '           I    BtOW BENNIE DID IT.    159 that very pompous style so often put on by men of unfeeling hearts when they think a needy seeker for favor is before them. "I have learned of you, Mr. Stout, through a . friend," said Mr. Smith; 'and I felt at once that it would be to me a great pleasure if I could induce you to accept a place in my house. Your health, I understand, is so far recovered that you are proposing again to engage in busi- ness."  "{I thank you very heartily, Mr. Smith," re, plied Mr. Stout, "for your kind purpose in my behalf. It is true that I am now seeking busi- ness; and true also, allow me to say, that so far as the impression of yourself which our few minutes' acquaintance has made upon me is concerned, I think I should be very happy to be connected with you. But I fear I can only decline the proposition." Mr. Smith's countenance showed real disap- pointment, for he was greatly in need of the services of just such a reliable man as Mr. Stout was represented tim to be. His busiL   160    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ness was a very large one; his confidential clerk and cashier had just entered business on his own account, and the fact was that Mr. Smith's necessities in this department were- simply urgent; and, from the moment that he had learned of Mr. Stout, he had been compla- cently enjoying himself with the prospect of securing services which would so clearly re- lieve his own shoulders from much of their heavy burden. That the position would be de- clined had not given him- a moment's thought; for he had made up his mind to offer a salary such as not one man in a hundred would fail. to consider in any other light than aS a great inducement. "Indeed, I regret to hear you say so, Mr. Stout," said Mr. Smith. "May I ask if you have already made an engagement?" "I have not," answered Mr. Stout, "and indeed I have none in prospect." The eyes of both Mr. Smith and Mr. Ellslie opened wide with astonishment. "Indeed, I would not be unduly inquisitive,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    161 Mr. Stout," said Mr. Smith, " but you surprise me much. Ninety-nine men out of a hundred, I suppose, would not only quickly seize upon this place, and at a salary, too, less than I would propose to you, but would be willing to give a bonus for it." "In that, Mr. Smith," answered Mr. Stout pleasantly, but with a hesitation that indicated his dislike to giving his reasons in the case, "you are doubtless correct; and if I could con- sistently do so, I would thankfully accept your kind offer. I repeat, that my short interview with you makes me believe that association with you'could not be otherwise than pleasant; my objection is the business!" At this announcement both Mr. Smith and Mr. Ellslie almost started from their seats. And had the former been other than the self- poised man that he was, he might have replied severely; for such a remark, of course, more or less conveyed the idea of a disreputable busi- ness. But' he controlled himself thoroughly, and replied with  his accustomed manner, a3 1    162    HOW BENNIE DID IT. even with a smile that indicated all absence of unkind feeling. "I am, of course, not a little surprised, Mr. Stout," said he, " that you should make such an objection, especially as the business transac- tions of the house are in bulk; and with a position in the office, your only connection with the liquor need only be now and then in book or bill to write the word." "At the same time," replied Mr. Stout, "I would have such inevitable connection with the business, by holding any position whatever in the house, that my influence, whether small or large, would be cast practically in the same direction. I am aware that a, broad dis. tinction may be made between the business as conducted by yourself and that of the re- tailer; but, for the sake of my children, even were I influenced by no other consideration, I cannot consistently have any connection with it." "Hadn 't you better give the matter a day -or two's thought, and not now make your   T HOW BENvIE Di IT.    163 decision?" asked Mr. Smith. "I am willing to reserve the place; and more than this, will offer you such a salary as will make a very unusual inducement." !"I hope you will excuse me, Mr. Smith," answered Mr. Stout, "and neither consider me obstinate nor morbid on this question; but there will be nothing gained, I am confident, by my thinking longer upon it. I thank you again, most earnestly, for your kind intentions in my behalf, and only wish the position was one I could consistently accept "; saying which, he rose to bid the gentlemen good morning, but was detained for a moment by Mr. Ellslie. "May I   ask you a question, Mr. Stout?" asked that gentleman. "Certainly, sir." "Did I understand you to say that you have no situation in view?" "I have none in immediate prospect, Mr. ElIslie," replied Mr. Stout. "Have you not received intimation concern. ing an office soon to be vacant, and in which   164    HOW BENNIE DID IT. some of your friends have beei making an effort to place you?" The startled and surprised expression of Mr. Stout's face gave Mr. Ellslie an unmistakable reply to his question. Indeed sir," answered Mr. Stout, "you sur prise me. This is the very first intimation ] have received that any such movement is o0 foot." "Then I regret," said Mr. Ellslie, " that have made any reference to it; but I wa thinking that your knowledge of that matte might be influencing you somewhat in declminin Mr. Smith's offer." "I am sorry," answered Mr. Stout, " that yo should have thought that I misstated my re: sons for declining. It is indeed with a feelin of sacrifice that I do so, but had I accepted, would have been by a compromise of principl, for I consider the liquor traffic as a wrong th is inflicted on society at large so great as to l beyond any computation. Mr. Smith, I hop( continued he, turning to that gentleman, ' w   HOW BENNIE  DID IT.    165 pardon me for speaking thus, for it would seem as though I ought not so to return his kindness. I feel that I cannot do him a greater favor than to wish that he may yet view the subject as I do, and then consecrate his busi- ness talents in such a way as that they would be like showers of blessings upon all with whom he may have to do." To Mr. Stout's relief, Mr. Smith extended him his hand, and as he bade him good morn- ing, said, "I take no offence, my dear sir, I assure you, at what you have saidl and while I think you are doubtless influenced -by the overwrought views which often make men unnecessarily rigid, I nevertheless respect you as an honest man whose services I deeply regret that I can- not secure. If in some other business way I can be of advantage to you, please command me." Mr. Smith sat down in a very thoughtful mood. "That man doesn 't have a very exalted   166    HOW BENNIE DID IT. opinion of the whiskey business, friend Smith," remarked Mr. Ellslie, with a rather amused air. "No; and to tell the truth, I haven 't either," very gravely replied Mr. Smith. "Ha, ha," laughed his friend; "Stout's ser- mon took effect on you, did it?" ' Somewhat," was the short reply. "He preached it fearlessly, that's certain." "The fact is, friend Ellslie," said Mr. Smith, rising, and pacing the floor, "I wish, and this not for the first time, that I was- out of this villanous business. Here I am with abun- dance of wealth, social position, and all that, and yet a man on the eve of beggary, and whose family are needing the means which his services might command, refuses to asso- ciate himself with me. Money-can't buy him, but it does buy me." "Knock the heads out of your casks, then, and quit the whole thing," cried Mr. Ellslie, with a half sneer.. "Yes, that I might do, that's a fact; but   HO W BENNIE DID IT.    167 before it's done,' there ought to be some nice little calculations of dollars and cents, the aggregate of which, if set running as you suggest, might materially affect the financial condition of one William Smith." ' Stout didn 't stop to make any such nice little calculation, at any rate," replied Mr. -Ellslie. "True; and in that respect he is just so much better than I," answered Mr. Smith. !"Well, well, friend Smith," said Mr. Ellslie, as he gaily tapped his friend's shoulder, " do n't be over-anxious about the matter. Cheer up, and do all the good you can with the money you make, and you will doubtless come out all right in the end. One thing, however, is pretty certain: I like the ring of that man, and his friends may well recommend him as worthy of a great trust"; saying which Mr. Ellslie left the "'importer" to think out the case in his own way, notwithstanding there was a business affair which they had been discussing   168    HOW BENNIE DID IT. before Mr Stout came in that was to have been concluded on his departure. As to what were Mr. Smith's exact thoughts when he was left alone, we cannot say; but he had certainly learned one thing which he prob- ably hnad never quite known so well before, which was, that there are men in this world who have too much regard for themselves, poor though they may be in money, and too much regard for the influence which they may exert, even in business connections, upon the weal or woe of others, to accept any position that may be offered, simply because it promises much in money. Mr. Stout had made his mark that day for good, and his reflections thereon were sweeter than if he had- merely made a speculation to the amount of thousands of dol- lars. And as he went homeward at noon, he entertained himself with some of the amusing questions which he might put to the family as to their relish for the whiskey trade, etc., etc., in which he had received a proposition to eOm. . f    HIOW BENNIE DID IT.    169 bark I But in addition'to this he had some- thing else upon which to think, a matter upon which his eyes had been very unexpectedly opened. Over and over he found himself ask- ing the question, "What can the office be to which Mr. Ellslie alluded?"It was gratifying indeed to him to know that kind friends were interesting themselves in his behalf, and his courage and hope were proportionably stimu- lated by the thought, Indeed, with him  it became at once almost a foregone conclusion that whatever the position  was for which friends were thus exerting themselves, their efforts would be successful. So he went along encouraged and   happy; happy, too, as he thought of the pleasure which this news would afford to those at home. Before he reached home, however, he reconsidered his purpose to make the matter known, and decided that 'twere better to keep it secret until he knew more about it, and might be able to announce it as a  thing accomplished. True man and true father, carrying his burdens in his own   170    HOW BENNIE DID IT. heart,-too much so, perhaps,-and endeavor- ing as far as possible to reserve from the dear ones about the home hearthstone all that might be unpleasant. When he reached home there were, of course, many questions to answer.  Mrs. Stout was surprised indeed when her husband began to congratulate her and the family on the opening which!"father" now had in a whiskey store, where his salary would be so ample that all could enjoy the luxuries of life as in days gone by. Her heart really sank within her, at the thought that he was not equal to such a trial, but had yielded because the necessities of those dependent on him had urged. What a relief it was to her when she learned the truth, far dearer to her than any situation or wealth could possibly be I Disappointed though the whole family were that Mr. Smith's note and offer accom- plished nothing, they were nevertheless re- joiced that the result was just as it was. The mind of Mr. Ellslie, too, had been occu-   (HOW BENNIE DID IT.    171 pied with sundry unwonted thoughts as he left the counting-room of Mr. Smith and journeyed towards his own. "This," said he to himself, "is STOUT I If his action of this morning is a fair representation of his principle in general, I certainly have done him wrong. Who would have thought of his refusing such an offer? I doubt much, even should he get the cashier- ship, whether it will pay him so well. But the fellow stood up to his principles like a man, and he certainly deserves credit therefor. If he had known what NORTON and the others are doing, that would of course' have altered the case. Well, I don't know but that's the kind of man we want for a cashier, after all. Other men from their position might in some respects be helpful, but they certainly could n't be more honest; and take it altogether, I am considerably inclinedc' to give. him my vote. However, I won't promise just now, but will wait."   CHAPTER VIII. THE DAY for the election came round at last. The gentlemen of the Board who had other candidates besides Mr. Stout had been using all the influence they. could command for their respective men, but they had pretty much conceded the point that Mr. Stout was too far ahead of all competitors to render his election doubtful. The three gentlemen who had taken his case in hand had been energetic in their work, so that so far as prejudices against him were concerned, these were pretty well bat. tered down, and the only opposing feature would be the diversion of a sufficiency of votes to other candidates to prevent him from con- centrating the necessary majority vote. As to his record for integrity and qualification, they felt confident that his election would be en- *  ''/   tirely satisfactory to the stockholders, and to the benefit of the bank. At the proper hour, every member of the Board was present; and when the moment came for the election, some three or four gen- tlemen were nominated, Mr. Stout, of course, included. On the first ballot, Mr. Stout re- ceived seven votes; but although this was quite a step towards the necessary majority, the gen- tlemen who had made other nominations seemed strangely unwilling to withdraw their nominees unless this was done by all others, and entirely new names substituted. This was a new fea- ture, and looked as though outside influences had been at work to break Mr. Stout down. It was a movement which his friends had not anticipated, and which gave them some alarm. To meet this opposition effectively, it was ne- cessary that they should be as conciliatory as firm. So, allowing its men to present their case and work it as much as they chose, with- out any exhibition of ill-feeling, the "Stout" party courteously, though decidedly, held their   174    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ground, urging their purpose so to continue because they Relieved this to be the course of duty, as well for the interests of those whom they represented as because to their majority position concession was due. The result was, that the other nominees were withdrawn, and Mr. Stout was elected. And it was a pleasant feature of the whole affair, that the minority men exhibited no lingerings of ill-feeling that they were unsuccessful, but rather expressed their belief, "in the summing up " that 't was best as it was, and that they were happy that ,Mr. Stout had the place. That evening Mr. Norton (who was ap- pointed to notify Mr. Stout of his election) wrote the following note:-  Q --     18- . "WYLYS STOUT, Esq. "Dear Sir :- At a meeting of the Directory of the ' Merchants Bank,' held this morning, you were elected to tLe office of Cashier. If it will be agreeable to you to accept the position, I will be happy to have you meet me at my office at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, from   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     175 whence I will accompany you to the Bank, introduce you to our Board, and enjoy the pleasure of witness- ing your induction into office. If you should deem it necessary to decline, please notify me accordingly by the aforementioned hour. "Sincerely your friend, 1 SILAS NORTON." For reasons of his own Mr. Norton had chosen this method of informing Mr. Stout of his election, rather than by personal communi- cation. He felt quite confident that the family were unapprised of the matter, and that it would be to them an occasion of delightful surprise. And in addition to this, he rather shrank from imposing upon them the restraint of his pres- ence at a moment when their joy would be enhanced by having it to themselves. Accor- dingly he not only decided to communicate the good news to them by a note, but to send the note at that time when all would probably be assembled about the tea-table, and could have its contents for a pleasant addition to the meal. The whole affair was one of those delicately   176    HOW BENNIE DID IT. arranged conceptions which the generous heart always forms with pleasure, and which never fail to add a zest to the joy of such an occasion. Mr. Stout and his family, Bennie with them, had but just seated themselves at the supper-table when the door bell rang, and the note was handed in.  The fater began to read it, though not aloud, and although he said not a word until he had concluded it, the joyful surprise which lighted his face caused every one at the table to lay down knives and , forks, suspending the. whole eating business until their curiosity to know the contents of the note was gratified. , Thanks, thanks, thanks to the  Lord, for His kind remembrance and care of us," exclaimed he. "Listen, my dear wife and children, for this note brings us good news indeed." It may well be supposed that they all lis- tened most intently-while the note was read, and it- was interesting, too, to notice the variety of effect produced upon them; for   ROW BENNIE DID IT.     1" while tears, of gratitude streamed down the cheeks of the father and mother, Bennie's bright face was suffused with a smile of joy, while Susie ran successively from one to another, throwing her arms about their necks 'in a paroxysm of, happiness, and the other children clapped their hands, and danced alternately, to a degree which made them almost to appear as though joy  had long been a stranger to their hearts. "Come, my precious ones," said the father, after allowing them to give vent to the first outbursts of delht which the note had occa-. sioned, " let us, w ifut longer delay, kneel down and pour out- our hearts with gratitude to God; for surely we may believe that His favor rests upon us." And it was indeed a fervent and hearty expression of thanksgiving that was poured out there, to which every heart responded with its fullest tone. "Now, then," said Mr. Stout, when they had arisen, "our good friend Norton tells me what he wishes me to do, if I accept. So I suppose,". 12 ,     178    HOW BENNIE DID IT. continued he, with a quizzical look towards Susie, "we must decide the question, 'Shall I accept?' What do you all say?" Susie started to her feet with the intensest look of astonishment. "Why, papal" cried she, "what can you mean by asking such a question? Did n't we all kneel down just now and thank the Lord for giving you such a nice place?" "Certainly we did, my darling daughter; but do n't you think that papa ought to consult you all as to whether it will be agreeable to you' to have me accept it?" "No, papa, I do n't think we ought to consult anything about it. What the Lord sends, it is our duty to take, because He knows all about what we ought to have anewhat we ought n't." J'You are quite a little theologian," replied her father, patting her cheek. "I do n't know whether I am or not," was the artless reply of the child, "' because I do n't know what that means; and I don't want to be such a thing, unless it is something good."   HOW BENXIE DID IT.     179 Each in his turn expressed his or her pleas. ure that such a favor had been conferred on their loved father, and, through him, on them as a family. They had prayed and waited through days and weeks, during which all had appeared but as cloud about them, and now ,sunshine had suddenly burst through the clouds, illumining their home and their hearts with a brightness that was like to beauty itself. Bennie had now been long enough in busi- ness to appreciate most fully the value of the position to which his father had been chosen. He wellsenough knew that the salary, ample though it might be, was in one sense the least important feature to be considered. The office itself was creditable; it would bring his father more or less in connection with gentlemen whose companionship and influence would be invaluable; it was an office which, if so dis- posed, he could long retain, and which he prob. ably would have no occasion to resign until it had fully proved itself -a stepping-stone to some-   180     HOW BENNIE DID IT. thing better. So the happy boy congratulated his father on the, event, while his heart kindled with a sensation of pride that his beloved pa- rent would again be taking his position on a prominent cqmmercial platform where his ca- pacities might be creditably and profitably de- veloped. There was one thing, however, of which both himself and his father were in igno- rance, which was the degree in which Bennie had indirectly been the means of bringing all this pleasant event to pass. A whole family were now to reap the blessed fruit promised to the training of children' in the ways of - righteousness. Think, parents, of your words and actions, and your example in every respect before your children; for the responsibility is great which rests upon you, and there is a vast difference between the comfort and joy which these children may bring to your hearts if their feet are turned in the ways of righteousness, and the bitterness they can cause you if they are " left to themselves." And you, too, children, forget not to yield to   BOW BENvzE DID It.     181 your parents all due obedience. Remember that the command which bids you, ",Honor thy father and mother," has connected with it a promise of blessing; and if you would seek hInppiness for yourselves for the life that now is and for that which is to come, treasure the commandment in your hearts, and practise it in your lives, and you will not fail to realize that its promises are true. "My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck." Proverbs i., 8, 9, Brightly indeed shone the next morning's sun upon the household of the "Stouts," and the father's voice was tremulous with the swell- ings of gratitude when, assembled as all were about the family altar, he led their devotions, and returned thanks to the "Giver of every ' good and perfect gift." And when he was about taking his leave, to meet Mr. Norton's t    182    BOW BENNIE DID -IT..  invitation, his wife and children clung about and caressed hitm as with the joy of hopeful and overflowing hearts. Oh, how strong he went forth, made so by a blessed agency, and by the encouragement there was to do for a family such as his. "We've prayed for you, papa dear," said the loving little Susie, " and we 'll keep praying that our Heavenly Father will help you to do everything that is right, and make the gentle- men at the bank to love you very much." His heart was too full to say much in reply; and, hastily kissing them all, he stepped forth to meet in a new sphere the warfare of life, and to know some of the strange experience by which even the genuine child of God is led in this world of change. Mr. Norton met him with accustomed cor- diality, and they were soon on their way to the bank. Arriving there, it was not long before the gentlemen of the Board were pres- ent, and Mr. Stout was presented formally to them all. His long cessation from business,   H VOW BENNIE DID IT.    183 and home confinement, had given him a kind of apprehension, bordering almost on timidity, at the thought of again being brought hand to hand with the friction of life, and especially as being the employee of others. But this feeling was soon-dissipated by the, kind, and in- deed even respectful reception which he met from the entire Directory; for indeed those gen- tlemen of the Board who were his personal friends had so represented him to the others as to have already established for him a repu- tation which commanded more than ordinary respect; and, furthermore, the affair in the counting-room of Mr. Smith had so impressed Mr. Ellslie that he was now well nigh vener- ating the man whom he had once so bitterly denounced; and he had hot failed, even from the time of his conversation with Mr. Norton, to do all that he could by way of making an influence among other members of the Board in Mr. Stout's favor. And from the present day, on through all the subsequent years daring which he and Mr. Stout remained together in   184    HOW BENNIE DID IT. the bank, the latter had no surer friend in the Directory than Mr. Ellslie, nor any one with whom he maintained morepleasant association. The morning papers told the story that Bennie looked for with so much pleasure, even the official announcement of his father's . election to the office of cashier of the Mer- chant's Bank of Q-- ; and when the ' Stouts" that evening came together around the family board, there was a joy on the countenances of all that would easily have assured even a stranger that something of special interest had / transpired which made :them more than ordi- narily happy.   CHAPTER IX. ENNIE'S attention to his business continued as unremitted as though he were a deeply interested partner in the house. He was far from being a mere "eye-servant,"-far from being one who seemed disposed to do just so much, and that as little as possible, but kept ever posted upon all commercial features that might at once or at some distant day come before him for attention, and in all of his inter- course with the patrons of the house, his man- ners were so conciliatory and at the same time so earnest and business-like that he became a favorite with all. There were times when cer- tain transactions caused difficulty to arise, such as would have resulted in ill feeling and aliena- tion of the customer from the house.  But Bennie was invariably the "peace maker" onall   186    HO W BENtIVIA DID IT. such occasions, and it seemed as though he were naturally turned to as the referee by all parties, even by those who ordinarily  would have thought that as his interests were with the house so would his decisions be, even at the expense of justice. But in all cases he was firm in advocating what he considered was the right. It must not, however, be supposed that he always was right, for this would be asserting for him that he was "' more than man." Neverthe- * less, he was as prompt and just in retracting any wrong position as -he was firm in main- taining what he considered the right one. Some months after the occurrence of the in- cidents narrated in the previous chapter, and while Bennie was at his desk in Mr. Wilson's office, two gentlemen, principals of two large concerns somewhat similar to Mr. Wilson's, came in and seated themselves for a special consultation. "You are largely in flour, just now, are you not, Mr. Wilson?" asked Mr. Hawley, the elder of the two visitors. /'   ROW BENNIE- DID IT.     1871 "BRather so," was the reply. "You know of course of the burning of the Netumpsick Mills?" "No," exclaimed Mr. Wilson greatly sur- prised;, " when did the fire occur?" "This morning, but too. late for the de- spatches to reach the papers before going to press. We have private despatches, as our Ne- tumpsick correspondents know that we are holding considerable of the flour." "Well," said Mr. Wilson, with the air of a ' man whose wits seemed to be rapidly sharpen- ing up with something specially hopeful, "I guess it will be some weeks before the old fa- vorite 'Netumpsick' will be shipping any more of her brand, won't it?" "That's just the point," answered the other gentleman, Mr. Simpkins, that 's just the point; and as Q--  doubtless to-day holds ten bar- rels to one over all other points, and our three houses the bulk even of that, we may, by mov- ing energetically, make a good thing of it, do n't you see?"   188    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "I see," said Mfr. Wilson, who was as wide awake just then as either of the others. " en- jamin," said he, "you are pretty well ac- quainted with the Netumpsick' stock, are you not?"                l "Yes, sir."  "I would like to have you go through the market (our young readers will please under- stand that Mr. Wilson meant by " the market" simply the various houses which were in the habit of keeping the "Netumpsick" brand of flour) with as much haste as possible, and buy up every barrel that you can command at ten dollars." "You will have to use all the caution possi- ble, my boy," interposed Mr. Hawley, with a knowing sort of leer towards Bennie, "or you will be suspected, and the price will rise on you."  - Bennie had heard the whole conversation, and was not longer in '" seeing the point" than was Mr. Wilson, and he had his own opinion about the whole thing. As to the " caltion"   "HOW BENNIE DID IT.    189 that was urged upon him by Mr. Hawley, he gave its author just as little of a complacent reply- as in his position might be deemed allowable. But to Mr. Wilson, he quietly said: ' We have no orders, I believe, sir, to-day, tor purchase or ship ' Netumpsick' on account of any of our correspondents; and as to doing so on our own account, may I suggest that you look to the unfavorable foreign advices just received?" "You are correct, Bennie," quickly replied Mr. Wilson, who for the moment thought that the youth was rather doing what he was not asked for; "but please be expeditious as to the instructions I have just given you, for this has reference entirely to a little home opera- tion, by way of variety."   / ' Certainly, sir," said Bennie, as he moved hastily to obey his employer's orders. But as he passed out of the office, and in so doing turned a hasty glance toward Mr. Wilson, their eyes met, and the merchant quickly read in   tHOW BiNN1I DID IT. those of his trustful young friend an expression of sad reproach that was full of meaning. Although Mr. Wilson thus sent out his own agent to buy up 'he stock, it was of course understood that the three houses here combin- ing were to share equally in the benefits of the " operation," that is, so far as the amount went which Bennie should purchase.   The stock already held by each house was its own affair; but it was agreed that if he was successful in making a general purchase, so that the " combi- nation" could control the market the next day, the "Netumpsick " should go to eleven dollars, then twelve, and so on until it should reach fifteen dollars, each house to sell just as little as pos- sible until the price had attained this highest figure. Independent of the mere retailers, whose stock of the flour was of course insufficient to Control the matter either one way or the other, ;here were about a dozen houses that ".han. Iled" "Netumpsick."  Bennie knew them all, mnd for tlmatter knew pretty nearly the   HOW BENNIE DID IT.   191   amount they had on hand; and although he did not relish his errand, that is so far as he looked at it in its ultimate light, yet it was one of those commissions which in his position he considered it simply his duty to obey according to his employer's instructions. But there was one thing upon which he was fully determined, and that was, to practise no subterfuge in the trans. action of the business.  He proposed saying nothing as to the information he had, but to buy flour of all who were willing to sell just as though it was his every day affair; and if there were any special inquiries as to the " why and wherefore," the facts he would not withhold, and the holders might then sell or not as they preferred.  He, however, found no difficulty with most of the houses to which he went. Ten dollars was the figure uniformly asked and accepted, the sellers at this rate making their or- 'dinary profit, with which they were content, and entirely unconscious that the mill's accustomed weekly or semi-weekly shipment to them of the flour would not be forthcoming.  But there     HOW BEBNN'IE DID IT. was one house where Bennie was buying, in which a gentleman happened to be present who was connected with another concern that also dealt in Netumpsick.  This -gentleman who heard the sale made, probably at the moment thought nothing more of it than to wish that he had made it himself, and soon after was in his own office, which Bennie also entered within half an hour. To Mr. Williamson this early visit from Ben- nie, accompanied as it was with an inquiry for more "Netumpsick flour," was a something so entirely unexpected as to cause that gentleman to open his eyes wide with astonishmenft. "Why," exclaimed he, " it's but a few minutes since I left you buying Harvey & Son's stock; is there anything special the matter with' Ne- tumpsick' this morning ?" "Well," replied Bennie with a smile, as he looked at Mr. Williamson's startled counte-- nance, "there is this much special the matter, that if you wish to sell, I am ready to buy." "At what price ?"   "The same at which I have bought else- where, ten dollars." "Have n't you a pretty large supply already on hand? " asked Mr. Williamson. "Yes, we almost always carry it heavy, but as a general thing not more than our trade demands. But we are wanting a few thou- sand barrels to-day for a special purpose." " With what you already hold, how is it that you can't wait a little longer, and stock up from the mills ? Unless your demands are strangely pressing, it would surely pay you to wait and make the extra profit to be obtained by buying there 1" For a brief moment Bennie was unable to reply. Almost any one else could have promptly framed the excuse that " the flour was wanted to-day"; but he well knew it was not, and he would not have said that it was, even if by so saying he could have secured the purchase. And as Mr. Williamson was a "wide-awake man," he detected Belnnie's hesitation in an in- stant, and suspected that something was brew. 13  194    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ing by which he could do better by holding hi3 flour than to let it go for ten dollars per barrel to-day. "Come. Stout," said he, "own up; some- thing's in the, wind about 'Netumpsick,' I'm certain. Your honest face tells on you; and as my five hundred barrels are not now for sale you might as well let me know it to-day as to- morrow. I'm determined not to sell until better posted. Out with it Bennie, is the mill all right?" "My commission is to buy flour just now, Mr. Williamson," replied Bennie pleasantly. "But my commission is not to sell," answered the gentleman in the same tone. "Very well, if you won't sell, I of course can't buy, and I suppose I must try elsewhere. So far as the mill is concerned, the only thing that I know of about it is, that it this morning stopped making flour and went to making ashes!" answered Bennie, with a hearty laugh. "No!" exclaimed Mr. Williamson, Catching i Bennie by the shoulder, and giving him such a :      '          .    JuOW BENNIE DID IT.     195 twist as he never experienced before, "Not burnt!" "Yes, sir, burnt! but do n't you think you 're dislocated my shoulder?" answered Bennie, rubbing his upper arm, and laughing heartily. "It would n't have grieved me much if I had, if I had sold you my flour; but, as I did n't, I regret most heartily that I gave you such rude handling. You may go to your surgeon, get him to mend up your shoulder, and send his bill to me; for I have an idea that by this time to-morrow the advance on my five hundred 'Netumpsicks' will enable me to pay the bill easily, and have considerable to spare. But what are the particulars about the mill?" "I know nothing- more than that it was burned this morning," replied Bennie, "and of course, some considerable time must elapse before its flour will be coming forward." "All right," said Mr. Williamson, "and I am inclined to think that some considerable time, as you say, will elapse before my stock of it will be for sale. The probabilities are, that if   196    HOW BENNIE DID IT. your house and any one or two others are com. bining on it, poor folks will rapidly acquire a taste for cheaper grades." Bennie's head dropped with a sense of bitter shame, for he well enough knew that this last suggestion was to be one of the cruel conse. quences of the "combination," and lie hated the idea that he should in any degree have con- nection with it. In his estimation, such " oper- ations ' were no part of a legitimate and honorable business. 'rue, they might be looked upon by men in general as "good things," and all that, but Bennie's soul was too much moved by that heavenly principle which "worketh no ill to its neighbor," to admit thalt such transactions could be righlt in the sight of God. The teachings of Jesus his Saviour, so overflowing with love, so devoid of selfishness, even that "New Commandment," "that ye love one another," took place in Ben- nie's milnd and heart, not as a mere expression that was to be the climax of beauty to a code of impracticable morals, ut as a vital teaching   fBHOW BENNIE DID IT.            197 to be inwrought into heart and life, as well on earth as in heaven; and he, therefore, could not give his assent to one man's building up his own interest by a deliberate and wilful oppression of his neighbor. "Good morning, Mr. Williamson," said he, "I fear that your remark will too quickly prove correct, and my sympathies are stirred most heartily for those who are compelled to suffer at such times." "Ha, ha," gaily replied Mr. Williamson, "your expressions of sympathy and your ac- tions do n't seem to me to harmonize very well; for here you are the representative of one of the very parties by whose work the result which you pretend to deprecate will most surely come." "I am in Mr. Wilson's employ," answered Bennie gravely, "and purchases of this kind come entirely in my range of service." "But if Mr. Wilson instructs you to do dirty wolrk, you are not compelled to obey." "Nor would I," was the prompt reply: "the   198    nHOW B ENNVIE DID IT. mere purchasing of flour as I am this 4morning commissioned to do, at its legitimate value, as I look at it, devolves no moral responsibility on me. When the time comes for selling, I may view myself in a changed position, although of course even then much will depend on the circumstances under which the sale is to be made." "I am inclined'to think that you have over- looked an important feature in the transaction, even on the purchasing side," said Mr. Wil- liamson. "What?" quickly asked Bennie. "Have you not made all your purchases this morning under false colors?" "I have n't displayed any colors," answered the youth, smiling. "Didn't you induce the various parties of whom   you bought to sell under a wrong impression?" "I made no attempt to impress them with any other idea than that I wanted to buy, if they were willing to sell."   I          HOW BENNIE DID IT.     199 ' True; but you took advantage of their ignorance, for it is not likely that any one of the houses would have sold you its 'Netump- sick' at ten dollars, if at all, had it known that the mill was in ashes."' "You are no doubt correct in the last sug- gestion; and as to the taking advantage of their ignorance, I do n't know but you also have a point there that is proper to be con- sidered. That is one thing; but the flour, as an hour ago held by all those houses was for sale at ten dollars per barrel to any purchaser who chose to buy. The sellers got all they asked, and were entirely satisfied with the sales." "-I'd like to look on the countenances of some of them about two hours from now," interposed Mr. Williamson, gleefully rubbing his hands as he thought of his own escape. Bennie could not restrain lis laughter as in imagination he looked at some of the rueful countenances that would doubtless be exhibited "two hours from now"; for he could easily    200    HO W BENNIE DID IT. conceive that they would make a group for a painter. 'But," continued Bennie, " the buying up of an entire article with deliberate purpose to con- trol and inflate the market, there being no necessity nor design in so doing other than that of avaricious gratification, and this too in con- nection with an article essential and indispensa- ble to the poor equally with the rich, is another thing, and which in my opinion has no justifi cation." "Very well," answered Mr. Williamson, "make the case out, to suit yourself: the combi- nation I have no doubt will suit me to perfc- tion, for you may depend upon it that my five hundred Netumpsicks and I won't part com- pany until the brand has touched its best figures. You know," continued he with a very conscien- tious air, " it would be highly uncommercial in me to break the market with an under-cutting figure." Bennie repeated his "'good morning" and left. As he had now gone through with the prin-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     201 cipal houses, he had but to return to the store and report; and he reported to Mr. -Wilson in full, even to the details of his conversation with Mr. Williamson, adding nothing however as to his opinions concerning the " operation," for it was not his habit to volunteer any such service. He well- enough knew that the necessities of the case would develop all that in proper time: he knew too that there was a latent conscientious- ness about Mr. Wilson, which when the right moment should arrive would surely respond to every healthy suggestion. Before the afternoon was through, the news of the Netumpsick fire had become generally known, and some pretty hard talking had been done on the part of those who during the morn- ing had sold out. Mr. Williamson had con- cluded that he could enjoy an hour or so in two o or three of the counting-rooms of the aforemen- tioned parties, and so started forth therefor. His first visit was to a Mr. Jenkins, who he knew had opened the day with a few hundred "Netumpsicks" on hand, - a man who esteemed   202    HOW BENNIE DIP IT. himself especially shrewd, and in fact was gen- erally the better off in pocket as the result of every business enterprise or "operation" in which he engaged. And Mr. Williamson well knew that if this gentleman had disposed of his flour to Bennie, the idea that he had been " out- done" would annoy him even more than the loss of a speculative profit. He had heard the news, and Mr. Williamson consequently found him in no amiable mood. "You did n't sell this morning, Jenkins, did you?" asked the visitor. "Yes," was the very short reply. "Pshaw I " exclaimed Mr. Williamson, affect- ing considerable concern, " not to that boy of Wilson's, did youz?" "Yes, and I would n't cry if some of the flour should yet be made into a dumpling that would choke the boy and, Wilson too I " replied he, impatiently walking to'and fro. It was all that Mr. Williamson could do to restrain an outhurst of laughter. His delight was two-fold; first, that his own flour was safe   BOW BENNIE DID IT.    O203 in his warehouse, and second that Jenkins was "beat." "I'll be even with Wilson," continued Mr. Jenkins, "if it takes me a year's work. To think that the old rascal should coolly have been sitting in his office and sending one of his boys to wheedle me!" "Why," replied Mr. Williamson, with the delightful composure which his own secure po- sition enabled him to enjoy, "Wilson bought your flour on your own terms, did n't ho?" "Yes, but the old scoundrel -took advantage of my ignorance to accomplish his purpose." "Were n't you well satisfied when you made the sale at ten dollars?" "Yes, but it's not very comforting to think that next week I might have got fifteen!" "I enjoy that prospect inexpressibly," replied Mr. Williamson, with a provoking coolness. "But I   thought you had sold too!" ex- claimed Mr. Jenkins, almost in a rage. "Not exactly," answered the visitor, as se. rene as a May morning, " not exactly 1"   204     HOW BENNIE DID IT. "But I was informed that Mr. Wilson's young man went to you soon after leaving me." "So he did; but he didn't get my flour. I had other use for it." "What use!" cried Mr. Jenkins, as though he had for the moment forgotten that Mr. Wil- liamson might have needed his flour with which to fill orders. "To get fifteen dollarcs per barrel for it!  Mr. Jenkins dropped into a chair and laughed outright, for the idea just then seemed to flash through his mind that Mr. Williamson had only come there to enjoy himself at his expensive. Thus recovering his good humor, he was ena- bled to accept the position with a better grace, and talk about it without the exhibition of bit- terness.     / "All right, W//liamson," said he, cheerfully; "I acknowledge that you've 'all got the start of me this He, and I guess it will all come out right in the long run. It's not often I 'm caught 1- napping, so we may hope that this little nap will freshen me up. Keep your eyes open f   BOW BENNIE DID IT.     205 from this time forward, for I give you warning that if we all live, I 'll put the joke on the other shoulder before you're much grayer." Mr. Williamson bade him good-by, express- ing the hope that Jenkins & Co. would " look to their laurels," and not come out second best in future " operations." From this house he made the circuit through such others as he thought were in like condition, and enjoyed "looking on the countenances" of the various parties to his heart's content. He was witness to some wry exhibitions, certainly, such as afforded him a laughter-fund for many days toi come. A little scene that occurred the next morn- ing in the store of Mr. Hawley, one of the "combination," showed how the matter was to be worked. "Have you any 'Netumpsick' flour?" in- quired a customer, one of the uninitiated kind, whose business was purely legitimate, confined to steady demand, and who' was never posted so far as knowing the probable amount in the market at any given time.   206    . O HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Well, yes," leisurely replied the clerk, Mr. Stevens, who acted according to instructions, "we have some, but not much to spare. You want only a few barrels, I hope." "Half a dozen, or so; btt is it so scarce'?" "You know, I "suppose, that the mill was burnt yesterday?" was the evasive reply- {' Yes, I know that, but thought little of it, presuming, of course, that there was a sufficient amount of it among the different dealers to last until the mill would be running again." "Oh, yes, there is a fair supply of it on hand; but as to there being enough to hold out, I can 't say." "Well, let me have from five to ten barrels; your regular customers you will, of course, supply as liberally as possible. The price will be to me the same as last week, won't it?" "'!'Oh, no," said Air. Stevens, with an amused look, "the pries has advanced to eleven dol lars." "Eleven dollars. That 's hard," exclaimed the baker (for such he was), "and will make (,   OW BE. NNIE DID IT.    207 bread an unprofitable item at present weights. I think I 'll wait a day or so, or see if some other house can't do better." "Very well," replied the clerk, better suited thus than he would have been in selling; "I would be happy to sell you, but the figure is the lowest I am authorized to take." The man left, tried other houses, found but few who had \the flour at all, and these were holding the price firm at eleven dollars. "I'lll wait until to-morrow," said he; and he waited. "I guess I'll have to take that flour any. how," was his short-hand salutation to the clerk the next morning. "It 's too\ bad to be walked up on'at the rate of a dollar a barrel, when, it seems to me,-there is no real necessity for it." "Why," replied the clerk, as he gave the man a surprised look, "are you expecting to get the flour at eleven dollars?" "Certainly; didn't you tell me yesterday that eleven dollars was the price?"   208    HOW BELIVKIE DID IT. "Yes, that was yesterday's price; but we are not selling at that figure to-day!" "Are not?" exclaimed the man, with an appearance of downright alarm; "then what on earth are you selling at?" "Twelve." The poor baker became almost furious. "Have you sold much of your flour since yesterday?" cried he. -"Not a barrel," replied the clerk, coolly. "Then the whole movement is an infamous and swindling extortion," exclaimed the man, with indignant rage, "based neither on the scarcity of the flour, nor any corresponding advance in other lines of goods ; and if every- body looked at it as I do, your flour would stay where it is until it was rotten. Before I'll buy another barrel of 'Netumpsick,' until it conies again to its level, I '1l shut up my shop;" and so saying, he turned upon his heel and left the store. But what cared the clerk for that? His instructions were plain, his   ^:Hi!      -  : OW BENNIE DID IT.    209 Hsalary was sure, and he could enjoy the man's indignation with perfect complacency. And what cared the principal of the house? He knew well enough that if one man did n't buy, another would; and as to the question whether there were vast numbers of people with whom a loaf of good bread was one of their luxuries or- not, and one which they might have to do without, that did n't enter his mind as a ques- tion which should influence his "operations" in the slightest degree. When the baker left the store of Mr. Haw- ley, he proceeded to the store of Benson & Co., who he knew were dealers in other brands of flour, inferior but cheaper. "Are you still dealing in I Wascosset' flour, Mr. Benson ? " asked he. " Certainly," replied Mr. Benson, pleasantly, "and will be happy to sell you some." " Well, that will depend upon the price. What is it ?" ' Ten dollars only." "Only !" said the baker, "were you not sell- 'ag it at eight dollars last week ? i 14   210    HOW BENNIE, DID IT. "Yes, but you know flour has been making a great stride for a day or so back, and we are compelled to advance. The fact is, we think that our flour is equal to ' Netumpsick or any other brand, and consequently that there is no good reason why it should n't always command as large a price. Nevertheless, we are to-day selling as we have been through the season at two dollars less than is paid for certain other brands." "But there is no particular reason that I can see why there should have been such an ad- vance on any brand, and especially on yours, for it is coming as freely into the market as ever." "You are correct, Mr. Lee. So far as the necessity in the case goes, there certainly is not any good reason for the whole thing; but when a body of men prompted by avarice can scent a breeze on which they can wing into a specula- tion, and so control a market, incidental com- modities all 'fall into line,' and so it goes. So far as I am concerned, I only know that flour,   HOW BEIYNIE DID IT.    2" all flour, has gone up in price and,may go much higher; consequently, all that I can do is to go with it, as I would have to do were it going. down instead of up." "Do you think it may advance yet more?" "That I cannot say, although I think it quite likely. But without reference to what may be, I shall sell on steadily, as purchasers may demand, without waiting for any speculative movements whatever." "And ten dollars is as low as you can sell to-day, is it? You know my customers will very soon- have a contention with me if I use an inferior flour, and if I risk the change, the price must be an inducement." "But 'Wascosset' is not an inferior flour, Mr. Lee."  "That may be so, but they will ask me very soon if I have made any change, and if they ascertain that 1 have, they will conceit that I have changed to the commonest flour in the market. However, I must have some, be it common or- not, and I'm -determined that so far   212    HOW BENNIE DID IT. as ' Netumpsick' goes, the men who are holding it to grind the community with shan't grind me " So he bought "Wascosset," and lost some of his best customers! Not many days passed before the whole com- munity was in high excitement on the question of FLOUR I The newspapers had an item about which to scold; and they did scold with an emphasis. The speculators had a specialty on which to " operate." The rich grumbled at the daily advance in price, but ate "Notumpsick " nevertheless; and the poor " rapidly acquired a- taste for cheaper grades l"But there were some-no, many-of the very poor, whose slender means had been but barely sufficient to procure just so many loaves, daily, at the prices: before the advance,- barely what hungry little mouths could be stinted to without being fully satisfied, and even that of the " cheaper grades," that now went bread-hungry much of their time.

Let- them go   BOW BENNIE ID IT.     213 bread-hungry if they could n't stand the prices, and leave "Netumpsick," and " cheaper grades," too, for that matter, for those who could. (So said the "combination.") True there was plenty of flour in the market to supply all home demands, and foreign too, and plenty of wheat with which to make more; but then the "com- bination " ascertained that the mill was burned before other merchants did; and if they could get control of all its flour, there could be no competitors to interfere with their "opera. tions ;" and so they would work "Netumpsick," and let other brands work themselves. As to operators in "cheaper grades," it they wanted to follow suit, and so make the thing bear hard on that class who had to, or did, eat such grades, why that was their own affair, and not to bp charged on the honorable and enterpris- ing "Netumpsick combination "i1 For the credit of "Court street," we are happy to say that not many of its merchants were of this {combination " style; for in the main they were as pillars, continually upholding and strengthen-   214    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ing the community, rather than as vultures that preyed upon its vitals. But let us look a little at the way the specu- lation was working in the hands of Mr. Wilson, and Benrnie. On the third day after the advance in prices had begun, a merchant of medium calibre, whose house was a few blocks distant, came in and wanted a hundred barrels of "Netumpsick." He needed the flour for actual and legitimate sales. At the moment of his entrance, both Mr. Wilson and Bennie were on the lower floor salesroom together, and the merchant went- directly to them. "I presume," said he to Mr. Wilson, "that you can easily anticipate the object of my visit this morning." "Yes," replied Mr. Wilson with a smile, "easily. You want of course to purchase our good ship Constitution, and make a voyage of discovery in her." "That's just it," answered the merchant, catching Mr. Wilson's jocose style; "but the   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     215 sticking point is, how at the present rates for flour we can raise money enough to supply us with bread for the voyage." "Oh, as to that, I have no doubt that-you and Bennie can easily trade. He's the flour man and will fit you out for the voyage with pleas- ure."  And having said this, Mr, Wilson found it very convenient to step aside a few feet ,to the desk of one of his clerks, as though an open sales-book which was lying there was just what he wanted to examine. But he took good care to select a position so that while his attention appeared to be occupied with the book, his ears could- also catch all the conversation of the trade between the customer and Bennie. "Well," said Mr. Warren, as with the air of a man who had a bitter dose to take, and was nerving himself to do it as gracefully as possible, "what s ' Netumpsick' to-day?" "Thirteen," answered Bennie, who was wish- ing in his heart that Mr. Wilson had attended to the business himself. "Only thirteen 1" To  ,                .   216    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ,' Only thirteen," repeated Bennie. "A modest figure, truly," continued Mr. War- ren, " but I suppose there's no help for it; one thing, however, is certain, I would much prefer that you should be doing this work than I." "If you think that I, individually, have any- thing to do with the rise, Mr. Warren, you are much mistaken," answered Bennie in a decided tone. "Mr. Wilson says you are the flour man, and as you are known to occupy a confidential posi- tion in the house, it seems to me that the gen- eral impression might as easily identify you with the movement as him." "Then," answered Bennie, with his most em- phatic manner, "I shall begin to undeceive the general' impression by informing you that I think it a gross wrong, with which T not only have no sympathy, but for which I have an ab- horrence. I may be over-conscientious, but at the same time I do not believe that everything in business transactions is right simply because it is customary. A mere money success is no   ? He  tf OW BENNIE DID IT.        217 evidence of a true-hearted man, nor even of an intelligent one; for there are thousands who Oi:  can make money whose capacity in other  ii  respects amounts to very little." A looker-on could not have supposed that Mr. Wilson had heard a word of this conversa- tion, but he had heard more than was palate- able, and now went to his office. "I 'am glad, indeed, Bennie, to hear you speak thus," said Mr. Warren, " and it has sur prised me that your house has been drawn into a work which will bear so heavily upon many  who are little able to bear the burden." "I deeply regret this myself, Mr. Warren, and I am quite confident that such a proceed- I i- inog would not have originated with Mr. Wilson.' But the houses who had the heaviest lots of the flour next to ourselves had no scruples about it; and as they well knew that Mr. Wilson was essential to the 'combination,' they drew him in before he had time to look at the matter in any other than its money light." "But you have influence with him; why -t   HOW BENNIE DID IT. did n't you use it?" asked Mr. Warren, giving Bennie a reproachful look. "My time has n't yet come," was the reply; "if I have any influence with Mr. Wilson, it has been greatly gained by an unvarying exhi- bition of respect, and by never intruding my opinions unasked. I was present when this combination was proposed, and went then somewhat beyond my habit by calling his attention to the unfavorable foreign advices we had that morning received concerning flour; but as those gentlemen were present, and he allowed himself, no doubt, to be elated with the 'home operation by way of variety,' as he ex- pressed it, I quickly saw that nothing could then be done with him, and said no more." "But do n't you suppose that he has by this time awakened to some misgivings in the case?" "I have been thinking that he has. Indeed, I began to notice yesterday that his ordinary enthusiasm in business successes was manifestly waning in the present matter, notwithstanding    HOW BENNIE DID IT.   219   the advance is inevitably to make largely for him; and had he felt his accustomed interest, he would not have left you as abruptly as he just now did when you began to speak of the price of flour." "Are you not afraid that he heard your re- marks to me about the whole affair?" "Possibly he did hear them; and indeed I would not be sorry if 't were so." "But if he did, would he think you were as respectfully considering his feelings, as has been your habit?" "I am confident," replied Bennie, "that I would not wilfully either speak to Mr. Wilson or of him in the least degree disrespectful or wounding; and I am sure he would not believe that I would. Yet, I repeat, that I should not be sorry if he had heard my remarks to you, for it would only be helping him that much on the road to an investigation of the merits   of the case. And you may depend upon it that if he were this moment to be convinced that he is party to a moral wrong, he would promptly   - 220    xOW BENNIE DID IT. obey his conscience and relieve himself in the best possible way from his position." "So I think," said Mr. Warren; " and I hope earnestly that he may soon look at the matter as you do, and check the evil before it has gone much further. But I must have some flour, be the price what it may." "How many barrels?" asked Bennie. "A hundred." "I'm glad you do n't want more." "Why?" "Because the 'combination' do n't admit of large sales for a day or two yet to come, in order, of course, that they may gradually do what they dared not do at once." "You speak rather fearlessly of the 'combi- nation,'" said Mr. Warren. ' And feel just as fearless as I speak," replied the youth, as his 1pl curled with an unwonted expression of scorn. "So to-morrow, if I want another hundred barrels, I must expect to pay fourteen or fifteen dollars, must I?" asked Mr. Warren.   I?        BOW BENNIE DID IT.     221. ' Without doubt," was Bennie's reply; "you may certainly make an extra hundred dollars by holding your present purchase until to-mor- row. "Which I won't do. The twenty-five cents discount -per barrel which you have always 1gi given me is all that I shall make, as thirteen dollars is all I will ask in selling to-day. The combination' may do its own work, and'pocket its own profits, but I will have nothing to do with either."  The sale was made, and the purchaser left. What Mr. Wilson thought when he heard the conversation between Mr. Warren and Bennie, and what he had been thinking up to I   the time that the latter returned to the office, we can't say; but Bennie certainly found him in a thinking mood, and looking much as if he did not want to be interrupted. He made an inquiry or two concerning the sale which was pending while he was down stairs, but this was only a pretence, as it were, to conceal some more important thought that was occupying his i          ,   HOW BENNIE DID IT. mind. When the hour came round at which he was accustomed to leave the store, he bade Benuie and all employees within the range of his walk from the house the usual parting for the night, but there were none who did not notice that his manner was changed. Bennie, especially, observed his employer's abstracted air and formed his own opinions, saying noth- ing, however, to any one as to what he thought, 'but doubting not that before mnany days would come round he would have a better knowledge as to what the trouble was. *   *   *   * '  * After making his purchase, Mr. Warren returned to his store, and was almost imme- diately visited by one of his customers who wanted a barrel of flour. The man was a mechanic, had a large family, and his wages were only sufficient by a close economy go enable him to supply those dependent upon him with the ordinary comforts of life. To him a dollar was an important item; he never had one to waste, never had one extra with which he   could even think of a little out of the way luxury. To him the days and weeks came with the same unvarying labor, the Sabbaths and the nights blessing him with rest, but nothing ever relieving his purse for any length of time from its exhausted condition. Nevertheless, he was thankful for what he had, toiled on, clothed his household neatly, and provided for the family board substantial food. Good bread he rel- ished as his luxury, and to the little stomachs which he had to fill he regarded it as better than a doctor's medicine. Mr. Warren was sorry to see this man come in, for he knew his condition, and feared he would now be compelled to forego his accus- tomed purchase. "I am here again, Mr. Warren," said the customer, his face glowing with the cheerful smile which neither poverty, anxiety nor toil had ever taken permanently from it, "and I suppose you know my errand, even without my telling it." "Yes," replied Mr. Warren, extending his   224    HOW BENNIE DID IT. hand kindly, "I no doubt can anticipate the object of your visit, and this is the first time that it has not afforded me pleasure to see you come." "And why is it so now?" inquired the man, with a troubled look. "Why, I suppose you know the great excite- ment that exists about flour, do n't you?" e"Well, yes," was the reply; ":I have of course heard something of it, but I had not thought it had gone so far but that you would have some that I could buy." "My stock was entirely exhausted yester- day," said Mr. Warren, " and I have had to buy this morning." "And what is the price?" it Thirteen dollars." Now the poor man's face lost its smile. "I cannot possibly afford it," said he. The additional three dollars is more than I car spare from other necessities which are just as important as bread!" and his eyes fell to the ground with that kind of despairing expressiot   HEOW BENNIE           DID IT.   225 !! J which is so common when the heart seems to :ii ^ have attained a climax of trouble. :i"!' I am indeedsorry," remarked Mr. Warren, "and wish it were not so.  These are the things that press severely on those who have to toil for their daily bread; and in the present i I   instance it is the more trying, because there was really no. necessity that it should be so." i "What has caused the advance?" asked the customer. I!"Avarice!"    quickly replied Mr. Warren, as his countenance almost blackened with an ex- pression of indignation. "There   is flour enough in the market, but all the stock of your favorite brand is in the hands of a few men who know well, enough that they can get their own price for it before the mill is rebuilt; and as long as they are satisfied on that point, thev care not for the oppression they may cause." A sigh escaped the poor and toil-worn father, but it was probably occasioned\ as much by a feeling of pity for the heartless men who were 15   226    HOW BENNIE DID IT. thus "grinding the faces of the poor " as by the consideration of his own perplexities. "Well," said he, "there are but few things that I can procure for my family or myself in the line of indulgences; and, so far as I am concerned, my chief luxury is good bread; to me, it is dessert and health. But I must forego that for the present, at least, and adapt myself to coarser and less palatable fare. And I will be thankful that I can even obtain that, as there will doubtless be very many who will not only have to change the quality, but will have to shorten the quantity of their bread until the times of easier prices shall return." So the poor man bought such flour as he could afford, and at night when he went home from his hard day's labor, instead of his spirits and stomach being strengthened and revived by the white rolls that had almost vied in color with the cleanly table cover, and whose sweetness had been to him a luxury, himself and family had to adapt their taste to the coarse and dark bread which they found it hard to enjoy. *    *   CHAPTER X. ONE EVENING, some days after the inci- dents recorded in the last chapter oc- curred, Bennie found himself connected with circumstances that were very unexpected. He had walked but a block or so, after leaving the store, when he was accosted by a child,--a girl aged about ten years, who asked him for help. Although the evening was one late in autumn, and the wintry winds were already beginning to blow, the child was but lightly clad. A thin sunbonnet but poorly protected her face and ears, while her shoulders and person were in no better condition, being only shielded by a light calico dress and a shawl so thin as to be ill adapted to the season. Her shoes, too, were not only almost as light as slippers, but were broken. Bat notwithstanding thids evident con-   228    HOW BENNTIE DID IT. dition of poverty, the child looked cleanly, in- telligent, and accustomed to better things. Bennie saw beggars enough, nay, too many; and his heart, always tender, never allowed him to pass them unheeded if he judged them at all proper objects for aid. But this child arrested him as none other had. Her sweet voice, mel- lowed by the sadness of her little heart, fell upon his ear with-a melody to which it was delightful to listen. So, not merely acting upon his generous impulses and giving her the pen. niea she asked, he halted full, and yielded him. self to a special interest in her case. "' For whom are you asking aid my child?" inquired he. "For myself, and "-she hesitated and hid her face in her hands. "And who?" asked Bennie, with a voice so full of kindness that she was at once reassured, and raised her head. "My mother, who is sick, and a dear little sister and brother, both younger than myself." a You have no father, then?"   ::         HOW aI BEVVIE DID I    229 -:It    "Our darling papa has gone to heaven," re- plied she, her voice trembling with emotion; ; iti!but her manner was expressive of a confidence that interested Bennie, and caused him for the moment to forget that she was asking alms. "Bow do you know that?" he asked. "Because he said he was going there," re- plied "she, as firmly as though- there was no doubt to be entertained in the case. "And how did he know?" persisted Bennie. "Because Jesus is the Saviour of all who believe on Tim; and papa believed on Him, I and loved Him too, and went to heaven to be with Him."  "I delight to hear you talk so, dear little one," said Bennie, 'and I doubt not that you have the best reason for saying that your papa has gone to heaven. You are exciting my interest, and I propose to assist you, and be. friend you too, and your mother and brother   and sister also." "Oh," cried she, clasping her hands with an indication of earnest gratitude, " if you do, how O   230    HOW BENNIE DID IT. very much we will all thank you, and I know that God will bless you too." "How do you know that?" said Bennie, with a rising feeling of interest in the child. i' Because we will ask Him to," replied she, quickly, " and He never turns away His bless- ing from those who consider and help the needy." Oh, how Bennie wished that his purse was "as long as his arm," and full of money, with hich he could always abundantly " help the needy"! He forgot, however, just then, the natural tendency there is in long purses to make hard hearts. "Will you tell me your mamma's name?" he asked. "Certainly I will. It is LISLE." "And yours?" "NENIE." "Nenie Lisle," repeated he. , I really think you have a pretty name. Do you go out often asking charity as you are doing to-night?" i* I have never done so before "; and again   "HOW BENNIE DID IT.     231 her musical little voice trembled, and her face dropped upon her hands, "And how is it that you are doing so now?" asked Bennie. "Mamma has been working herself sick, our money is gone, and we are neediing something to eat." "When your papa died, did he leave you in poverty?" "We were not always poor," replied she; "ebut papa's business and health both failed him, and he soon died. Then mamma knew she would have to work for her living, and she preferred coming here to staying where we were." Bennie drew some money from his pocket, placed it in her hands, spoke a kind word or two, and bade her hasten and procure some- thing for the family to eat. But just then, so busy had he been, questioning her about other matters, the thought came to him that he had forgotten to ascertain where she lived. "It may be, Nenie," said he, "that I can   HOW BENNIE DID IT.  send some kind friends to see your mother and help her; but I was near letting you go with- out asking where you live." "Thank you," replied the child; ",I know that mamma dislikes to see strangers, situated as she is, but indeed I am sure it would cheer her and do her good if some kind friends would call and see her. We are living at number ninety-seven, Mount Vernon street." "Ninety-seven, Mount Vernon streetl" ex- claimed Bennie, " wly, that is but a little distance from where I live myself; and indeed, if you are willing, I think I will go with you and see your mother now. Do you think she would object?" The child hesitated to reply. The generous and handsome youth who was thus proposing to visit the family in its poverty had, by his kind words and manner, quickly won his way into her own warm little heart; and while she would be very happy to have him accom- pany her, she doubted whether it would be agreeable to her mother to see him. Never- theless, she hoped the visit would be for good.   "I cannot say exactly," replied she, "how mamma will feel about it; but it seems to me that maybe the prayer which she made when I left her, that our Heavenly Father would help me to find assistance and friends, was in a very fair way to be answered by my meeting you. So, if you are willing to do so, I will say come " It was certainly an uncommon sight, that of this young couple as they walked along. The child alone was like a little vision of beauty; and were it not that the current of benevolent and Christian principle had a steady channel through Bennie's heart, we might easily imagine that the sweet face of Nenie had much to do with his present errand of charity. Indeed, it would be no hard work to understand how a youth of some nineteen or twenty years, just opening into bright manhood. and with mind and heart both keenly alive to the attractions of the beautiful and the pure, should in such a case as this have his sympathies and interest kindled to an unwonted degree. The face of   232 234    HOW BENNIE DID IT. the little Nenie was far too lovely not to have been peculiarly attractive to any one even less impressible than was Bennie. If ever there was a " mild blue eye " whose first look seemed itself like the germ of love; if ever a mouth about which perpetually played, like dancing sunbeams, the light of a heart radiant with gen- tleness and truth; if ever a voice that itself was music,-all were Nenie's. And to the artist, whose eye, searching else in addition to ex- pression, would have looked for feature, and line, and curve, and proportion, there was the tout ensemble that is sought long but found sel- dom. And just peering from thile little bonnet, as though anxious to escape its confinement, Bennie discovered here and there a flaxen curl whic'h he was more than once inclined to draw from its hiding and toss upon the beautiful cheek to which he thought it would give such a finishing grace. In striking contrast to this little fairy were the face and form of the generous youth, who by her side was bearing gladness to her heart   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     235 and home. Shaping up to the straight and full proportions of a graceful manhood, he seemed indeed a fitting protector for' the child. And when with a gentle hand, before they started on their homeward walk, he re-arranged her lighlt shawl that it might better shield her from the chilling wind, she looked into his full black eye, representative as it was of the workings of a heart on whose altar were ever burning the fires of that benevolence which savors of heaven, her young heart experienced a quick sensation of confidence and rest. So on they went, sur- prised, though delighted, with their novel situ- ation, Bennie the while receiving many a pleas- ant " good evening," accompanied with looks of wonderment, from friends who met him by the way. The house in whi Neie lived was a two: story frame, two roomsof thich were rented to her mother. Here the poor widow had removed some months before, supporting herself and little family by dint of hard toil and close economy. The bankruptcy and death of her   1HOW BENNIE DID IT. husband had left her penniless, but her spirit was unbroken, her health good, and her faith in God strong; hence her removal to Q ,where she could obtain a living without being depend- ent on those who might have felt her support somewhat a burden.  The interesting little family had thus far lived along from day to day without suffering, though their table was usually but sparsely set. But now the toiling mother was cast sick, or at least despondent, upon her bed, and the few shillings that had been her aggregate of money went like a flash. Every- thing in the line of provisions had been, and was high il price, except bread. That had been reasonable, and when. they might other- wise sometimes have gone well nigh supperless to bed, a loaf or two of the "staff of life " had checked their hunger, and made them thankful that there was a something that was cheap in price and baked ready to hand. But now even this last resource was closing; for where they had been able to procure three loaves, they could now only buy two I and on the evening when   HOW BENNIE DID IT.   237   Nenie, compelled by the hungry cries of the dear little ones whom she so much loved, had gone forth and met Bennie, they were out of money and could buy none! Bennie had often passed the house where Mrs. Lisle lived. That it would ever be to him the scene of interesting associations of course never entered his mind. When Nenie opened the front door, the hall presented to him a more cheerful prospect than he had expected to meet. The murky autumn day had drawn the shades of night rapidly along, and a lamp was already lighted. There was nothing to his view that indicated "a beggarly home." So as he en- tered he wondered. "Mamma's rooms are up stairs, Mr. Stout," said Nenie's musical little voice,--she had learned his name not from himself but from those who had saluted him on the way; "will you please wait here a moment until I let her know of your visit?" and she tripped up the stairs as cheerfully as though her young heart had  ,J   238    IHOW BENNIE DID IT. during the day been overflowing with joy in- stead of sorrow. Bennie being now left for the moment alone began to realize, more than he had, the strange situation in which he was placed. "What," thought he, " am I proposing to do? and what may Mrs. Lisle think of me, coming thus? Were I an elderly man, or a woman, a mis- sionary, a preacher, or any one else commis- sioned to charitable visitation or work, I could have an excuse for coming which I have not; but here, if the child is a fair representative of the mother, is a lady who may be morti- fied by the presence of a stranger to whom her deep poverty is known, and this stranger, too, but a young man from whom she might not naturally expect the kind of sympathy that would come so gratefully to her from a person of older years." The fact was, that Bennie began tothink quite seriously of making a quiet retreat, with a view of sending some one else to do the work for    HOW BENNIE   DID IT.   239 which he felt a growing conviction that he was unequal. And it may be that he would have done so, but just as he was about coming to this conclusion, the " musical little voice "called to him firom the head of the stairs,- "Please walk up, Mr. Stout," it said; "mamma will be happy to see you." This settled the "retreat" question, and he obeyed the invitation. And on entering the room where the sick mother lay, if his surprise was great before, it was much more so now. In some respects his own mother's chamber was not better nor more neatly furnished. True, there was nothing of very costly charac- ter, 'but what there was evinced a knowledge of style, and a refinement of taste not usual to a person educated in poverty's school. It was but the work of a moment for his quick eye to take in the mother, the children, the room, its furnishing, its style,--all of which not more pleased than surprised him; but when his "fine art" eye fell upon the two or three historic and sacred paintings that seemed animated with the   240    HOW BENNIE DID IT. inspiriting touches of a Murillo's or -kindred pencil, it was to him an almost overwhelming sensation that genius and beggary should thus be so closely connected. Poor boy! he had been working up his sympathies for the embar- rassed mother whom he expected to meet, but he was much mistaken; for, had it not been for the graceful and unembarrassed reception which she gave him, he would have been the one for whom the sympathy might have been felt, so ill at ease, for the moment, did he appear. "I am very grateful to you, Mr. Stout," said Mrs. Lisle to him, "for your kindness to my child, and tihe interest you have manifested in us by accompanying her to see us. Young as you are, and without probably having ever known the bitterness of such adverse circum- stances as ours, you of course cannot know how earnestly the sad heart appreciates a sym- pathizing act or word. When Nenie told me of your being in the house, awaiting my invita- tion to see me, my first thought repelled the   XOW BESN1iS DID IT.    241 very idea; but then came quickly the consid. eration that a kind Providence sent you, whose interposition it would be almost wicked in me not to acknowledge. But it really geems strange to me that you should be here on such a mission." "And it is not less a -wonder to myself, I assure you, Mrs. Lisle, that I am. But when I looked into the gentle face of little Nenie, as I first met her, it seemed so rich with eloquent pleading as to fill me with a desire to accom- pany her to her home that I could hardly re- sist. No second  glance was necessary to understand that hers was a   different need from that of scores of children whom we thus continually meet. The wonder to me is, how she could ever have summoned the courage necessary  to have undertaken so severe a task." "Our tHeavenly Father strengthens with grace according to their -day those who ask Him for it,"' replied the widow; "and I am certain that I earnestly commended the dear 16   242    HOW BENNIE DID IT. child to Him when she went forth; and indeed it seems as though she fell into good hands, and very different from what might naturally be expected." , But were you not afraid, Mrs. Lisle," asked Bennie, " to send her out on such an errand?" The poor mother shook her head sadly, while her eyes involuntarily turned upon the dear child, who was such a comfort to her in this their needy hour. "Ah, Mr. Stout,"' said she, "the time was I when I could not have done this, and indeeid would have shuddered even at the thought of it; but life often has bitter experiences with which we have to contend, and by which we are taught to submit to what aforetime we would have considered impossible." "But," continued Bennie, " will you excuse me for asking if there was not some friend or acquaintance to whom you might have applied for relief?" -, There are none here," replied she, "lupon whom we have any claim."   "HOW B ENIE DID IT.     243 "Not even those," persisted Bennie, " in the house with you?" "Oh, no," she replied; " most of all else just now would I fear to let them know our con- dition!"  "Strange," interposed her listener. "Yes, so it would seem, and may be I am wrong;, -but my conjecture has been that the apparent goodwill which they show us would be quickly withdrawn if they knew all." "They are not heathen!" replied Bennie, with just the slightest exhibition of impatience. Do I't you really suppose, Mrs. Lisle, that if they were acquainted with your sickness they would give you neighborly attention?" "Not if we told them we are beggars!" she ' answered in a whisper not designed for the children's 'ears. "I rather think you make a severer judgment in the case," said Bennie, with a smile, "than is justifiable, although you may, of course, have reasons of which I do not know." Mrs. Lisle's only answer was a sigh.   244     How BENNIE DID IT. i"Well," continued Bennie, fearing he had been a little intrusive on this point, "you will please excuse me if I have said more than I ought. I am happy indeed that I have been permitted to make your acquaintance, although under circumstances not agreeable to yourself. This favor I have to ask, that the acquaintance between us not only may be continued, but that I mey be permitted to introduce one or two friends who I am confident would take an interest in you." Had he that moment turned from the mother and looked upon the face of his little friend Nenie, he would have seen there a- quickly kindled smile of pleasure caused by the propo- sition he had just made. ,You may bring the friends," replied Mrs. Lisle, '" and may be assured, too, that all will be received by us with a grateful welcome. Naturally, I feel like shrinking from seeing strangers under such circumstances; but at the same time there is danger of sinking into a   BOW BENNIE DID IT.     245 morbid condition even on such a point. I have these dear little ones to think of, and for their sakes must not be over sensitive as to accepting your kind proposition." "Have you had a physician?" asked Bennie, who had noticed, with some surprise, that neither about her bed nor elsewhere in the room did there appear vials or pill-boxes or powders, so usual to be seen when the doctor is attending. "Oh, no," replied she, "my case needs no medical care." "Intdeed!" exclaimed he, with no small ex- hibition of amazement. "No medicine can be so helpful for me," said she, ",as rest, and the voice of sympathy. I have been growing sick at heart, with anxiety for my children, while unceasing labor and confinement have added to the burden, and simply worn me down.  You must not feel too much flattered if I tell you that your little visit to me has- already proved like the visita-   246     HOW BENNIE DID IT. tion of an angel of mercy, and is inspiring m with a courage and a hope to which I hav -been a stranger for many a day." "You hope that you are a Christian, do n' you, Mrs. Lisle?" "Yes," she replied. "' Has your faith grown weak'?" "I have no doubt," she answered, "that there are times when the faith of even the most joy ful Christian grows weak. Poverty, affliction and loneliness, combined with anxiety and con stant toil, depress the natural tone, and doubt less the spiritual at times falls with it." Be"nie's only reply was, to gently repeat a familiar verse which that moment came -to mind:  "The Lord can clear the darkest skies, Bid day succeed to night; Make drops of sacred sorrow rise To rivers of delight." "I believe every word of it," said the widow, "every word of it; and I pray that the Lord   HroW BENNIE DID IT.    247 D will forgive me that my faith grows at times so weak. Indeed, we ought never to doubt Him; for the fact that we may in this life walk through more or less of storm and trouble is no true indication that we are cast out from His love, or that He is not by these very means working out for us substantial and eternal good. Oh, what a blessed privilege, ' to walk ;in-the light of God.'" Even   the chubby little WTLT,.T, to say nothing of NENIE and her sister NETTIE, was aware that his mother was talking with a more cheerful and buoyant tone 'than he had heard her for a long time, and that her whole coun- tenance was growing more and more animated with the sunny expression it used to wear. Noticing this, and believing that some way or other Bennie had much to do with it, the little fellow had drawn closer and closer to his side, placed his hands confidingly on his knee, and was looking up into his face with an earnest and affectionate expression that was striking. And similar was the effect upon NwtiT:s and   248    HOW BENNIE DID IT. NENIE, who also were rapidly warming towards Bennie, and by their every motion and look showed their interest in him. '      All this the gratified mother noticed; and with a significant glance she directed Bennie's atten- tion to the little fellow at his knee. In an in- stant Bennie drew the child to his arms, and folded him to his heart as tenderly as though he had loved him from his cradle to the present moment. Then kissing all the children, and slipping something quietly into Nenie's hand he bade them all good night, with the promise, that it would not be long before they would see him again. Up to this moment, the little family, not even excepting Willie, had forgotten that they were hungry. But provided as they now were with money sufficient for the occasion, it was not long before Nenie and Nettie had procured from a neighboring store abundance with which to satisfy their hunger, and above all, a smoking cup of tea with which to refresh their mamma.   X HOW BEVNIE DID IT.   249 And although Mrs. Lisle had now been in bed for two or three days, she rose and partook A'    with her children of the humble meal, while her cheerful words and looks indicated a re- newal of health and hope. They were all very happy; thanked God with full hearts, and to- gl   gether sang praises in acknowledgment of His goodness, mercy, and love. Somebody else was also happy. When Ben- nie again stepped forth on his homeward way, buttoning his overcoat closely about him, his heart, too,was glad. And it is not too much to say, that no member of the "combinatim," although during the day having added thous. ands to his stock of dollars, was happier than he. It was very unusual that Bennie should be so tardy in his return from the business of the day, so that those at home were beginning to feel somewhat uneasy concerning him. Whenn his familiar voice and step were heard, he was con- sequently greeted with an extra welcome. But when he made a full explanation as to the \,          ..   HOW BENNIE DID IT. icause of his delay, all were not only gratified, but were thankful, and proud too, of such a son and brother. The LISLES found hearty sympa- thizers in the family of the STOUTS, at once; and this feeling increased to what might be called an enthusiasm, especially with his sister SUSIE, when she heard her brother's descrip- tion of the little NENIE. "You promised to visit them soon again, did you Bennie ? " she said. "I did." "And you included me I hope, as part of your-compauy ?  "I included any whom I might decide to invite," he replied; " and if you would like to go, you shall certainly be invited, my dear sister ": and he drew her to him and pressed upon her cheek the kiss that was prompted by a loving brother's heart.  A beautiful sight, indeed, this young sister and brother thus ambitious to labor together in  works of   charity  and love. Nevertheless, there was another visitor whom Bennie wanted to take with him in his next   visit to the Lisles, and that one only. So he promised his sister that she ard he would probably go on a visit to the Lisles very soon. That night Bennie's sleep was unusually sweet, as is usually that of those who have spent a day in' benefiting others, and with the morning light he awaked refreshed, strong, and cheerful for the privileges as well as the duties of the day. The family made an innocent little attempt to rally him concerning his dreams and their connection with a certain little blue-eyed NENIE of whom he had been so rapturously "going on" the evening before; but his mind was too full of purposes foreign to what they were talking about to be much affected by what was said. *      *       *      *      * Nine, ten, and eleven o'clock came, arid in the store and counting-room of Mr. Wilson the all-absorbing talk was FLOUR. "Netumpsick" had now been up some days to fifteen dollars, a figure never before reached in that market; and all other grades had gone in proportion, some, indeed, that had never been considered  252    HOW BENNIE DID IT. its equal almost commanding the same price. It seemed as th]oughl every man in the commu- nity who had anlly flour to -sell had become a party in the " combination." Watching a favorable moment, Bennie pre- sented himself at the desk of Mr. Wilson to makp a request. "If yo' are not specially engaged, Mr. Wil- son," said he, 'I would like to have a little eonviersation with you not having reference to business." "I have nothing very particular on hand, just now," answered Mr. Wilson very pleasantly. "On my walk honme last eveningr," said Ben- nie, "I met an interesting little girl, aced pro- bably about ten years, who was begging. Stop- ping for a moment to learn ,something of her case, I became specially attracted by the child, and was finally induced to accompany her home."' ' Very gallant, indeed, very," interposed Mr. Wilson, his face: lighting with an unusual degree of humor; " shel was very pretty, I suppose?"   HOW BENNIE DID IT.,    253 "Yes, sir, she was," replied Bennie, smiling , c. his employer's mirthful reception of what he had to say. "And was very sweet?" continued Mr. Wil- son, rubbing his hands in quite a glee. "Yes, sir, she was." "Well, you will excuse me for interrupting you, but I saw you were about to entertain me with more or less of a bit of romance, and I wanted to know all. there was about it. Pro- ceed, for I am already interested." "I have not a great deal more to say of the case just now," replied Bennie, 'except that on reaching the home I was greatly surprised to find an intelligent family, consisting of the mother and three children, who were without money, friends, or bread!" Mr. Wilson's face grew suddenly grave. "Who are they?" asked he quickly. "I can tell you but little more of them," answered Bennie, " except their name." "What is it?" SC LISLE."   254    BOW BENNIE DID IT. "SLE," repeated Mr. Wilson; "where did they come from?" - That I do not know." "But you know that they are in poverty?" "Yes, sir." "And friendless?" "Yes, sir." "And without bread?" l Yes,- sir." "Well, now, how do you know all this?" "They told me so." "Did the general appearance of things about the house indicate such a reduced condition?" "No, sir." Mr. Wilson looked perplexed. ' Pretty faces are very apt to kindle the en- thusiasm and sympathy of young men," said he. "Do n't you think it may be that you have allowed yourself to be deceived in this case, Bennie? From your own account of it, there is a .something which is unusual, to say the least. I am at a loss to understand how it is that a family, such as you describe, and having   1HOW BENNIE DID IT.     255 about them none of the indications of poverty, should, nevertheless, be in such abject poverty that the mother could have no other resource than to send her child -a girl, too -into the street to beg." "I can only reply to this," answered Bennie, "that this question occasioned me similar sur- prise; and in fact I told Mrs. Lisle as much. But without discussing the question- on- this feature of it further, I wish to ask the favor of you that you will go with me this afternoon to see them." "I 'll grant it most cheerfully, Bennie," -re- plied' Mr. Wilson, " and indeed am thankful- to have the- opportunity. If there is anything wrong in the case, it should be exposed; and if the family is one truly deserving, their con- dition they must feel most keenly, and relief should be extended at once. If you think the time will be agreeable to them, we will go at my hour of leaving business." "Thank you, sir," replied Bennie; "I was confident you would take an interest in the   256    IrBOW BENNIE DID IT. family, and am just as certain that you will believe them entirely worthv of your attention. The hour you have named was the one I in- tended proposing." Bennie's knowledge of his employer, as to the degree of his benevolence as well as the means by whichh to develop it, was not at all at fault. The merchant, though ever ready to respond to every proper call of charity, had not the happy gift of seeing, as many others do, as it were at a glance, the necessities in such a case. As an illustration of this, it is doubtless safe to say, that had he met the little Nenie on the street as did Bennie, the child would prob- ably have received a little money, and that would have been the last of it. No questions would have been asked, she would' have re- turned to her home, provided, 'tis true, with something for the family to eat, but in other respects- her heart, and her mother's, as cheer- less and depressed- as on the evening before, when the child went forth to beg. There was, however, this redeeming feature   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     257 about Mr. Wilson, that when once awakened to the genuineness of a call of charity, he did not withhold his assistanice even to the last extent. When he knew his duty, he did it, which, unhap- pily, cannot be said of us all. Bennie, as we have said, knew this as a characteristic of his employer, and therefore was quite confident that if he could at all secure his interest in the "SLES, they would at once have a friend who could and would do for them all that was needed. At the appointed hour the master and the' clerk were on the way in their mission of char- ity. Arrived at their destination, the little Nenie was the first to meet them at the door. And although Bennie thought her pretty the evening before, he now considered her charming; in which opinion he quickly knew himself to be sustained by Mr. Wilson, from the manner in which he regarded her, so full was it of admi- ration. "Mamma is much better this morning, I thank you, Mr. Stout, and will be delighted to see 17   258    ItOW BETNNIE DID IT. you," said she, with an air so womanly and lady-like as to at once surprise and delight Mr. Wilson. Bennie would have added much to his own pleasure just then could he have asked Mr. Wilson if it was not sometimes the case that " pretty faces were apt to kindle the en- thusiasm of old men as well as young ones "; for to the young man's mind there was one rather oldish man whose enthusiasm,just then appeared considerably gone in that direction. They found Mrs. Lisle up, and sewing, in which occupation Nenie quickly joined her. "I can hardly tell you, Mr. Wilsou," said she, after the gentlemen were seated, 'the benefit which I have received from the last evening's visit of our young friend, Mr. Stout. My cour- age and heart had sunk very low, but all this was dissipated by his cheerful words and man- ner; and it was but a short time after he left that I rose from my bed feeling well again, and with a renewed and strengthened energy." "I can easily imagine, my dear madam," said Wilson, "the condition you must have been-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     259 in, otherwise you would hardly have reconciled yourself to Nenie's seeking aid as she did." ' "Necessity is a severe master," replied the widow, a tear standing upon her cheek, "and in the bewilderment to which it brings us, we do we hardly know what. None of us can tell what we will do, or what endure, until the time of necessity comes." "Your health in the main, I hope, is good, Mrs. Lisle," inquired Mr. Wilson. "Oh, yes, sir, excellent." "Have you been able by your needle to sus- tain your family comfortably?" "No, sir; we have lived, but our living has been restricted to the merest necessities. One thing after another has been parted with to supply the deficiency my labor could not meet. Endeavoring, too, to educate my children by being myself their teacher, considerable time has thus been occupied, and I have had but little rest. Even the simplest provision for our table has been sometimes hard for us to obtain except in a stinted quantity; aud when the present ad-          260    HOW BENNIE DID IT. vance in flour and bread came upon us, trifling though the difference might seem upon each single loaf, the aggregate, nevertheless, would be terrible for such limited means as ours. This prospect seemed to me like a crowning trouble, and I became discouraged more than ever before. Judging from our own case, I * should think that such severe prices as are now demanded would bring suffering to very many indigent households." The widow was far from knowing that her words were doing an earnest work, the effect of which was- to bring a mighty revolution throughout the city of Q-- before it was forty-eight hours older. Bennie almost trem- bled as he listened, for as he had not planned, so neither had he expected to hear what he did. He feared, too, that Mr. Wilson would conceive that the whole thing was concerted; the conse- quence of which might be to wound his feelings, or stir his indignation at the thought that such means should be resorted to to accomplish what might have been otherwise done.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    a "Your remarks, Mrs. Lisle," replied Mr. Wilson, "make me unspeakably glad that I have called to see you." "I can hardly understand why." "Do you know the kind of business in which I am engaged?" he asked "No sir." "I sell flour," answered he, with a look that seemed to expect that she would spurn him. "That may be," she replied calmly, "and yet you may have no responsibility so far as the exorbitant prices are concerned." Bennie declined meeting the earnest look which was just then turned upon him by his employer, and was busily occupying himself with the children. "Indeed, madam," replied Mr. Wilson, his whole countenance indicating a feeling of deep concern, "I fear that I have had too much to do with the very thing that is bringing trouble upon yourself and doubtless on many others! But really it was more an ignorant than a   262     HOW BENNIE DID IT. wilful error on my part; for indeed I was blind to any such results, as well as to any moral responsibility, in connection with them. The transactions by which a mere speculation is obtained in business affairs we merchants too much look at as matters of course, and congratulate ourselves on every successful venture; whereas, were we to refrain from any connection with operations that were likely th entail disaster and suffering upon a community, especially its poor, we would certainly be more obedient to the injunction to do to, others as we would that they should do to us." Mrs. Lisle was greatly surprised to hear this confession from Mr. Wilson, and hardly knew how to reply. It seemed indeed a strange and contradictory position in which he stood to her, the cause alike of his proportion of the trouble she had borne, and now as the benev- olent visitor who had come to her with relief and blessing. "I regret, Mr. Wilson," said she, "that I   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     263 should have made any remark that could have the least personal reference,' But after all, we may hope that there is always a providence that overrules in such matters by which even the doer of wrong may see his error, repent, and 'bring forth fruit meet for repentance.' And if in the present instance I have said that which probably otherwise would never have been said-to you, under- the circumstances, too, which have influenced me, we may recognize the providential lesson, and act in accordance with its teachings. Thus may there come a result that will bring relief and joy to many, yourself among the number." "I would like to become acquainted with you, my little Nenie," said Mr. Wilson, almost abruptly turning from the mother to the child, "if you will let me." And he drew her gently to him, and kissed her cheek. "Do you know that I have never had such a treasure as a lov- ing little daughter?" Nenie replied with a look that showed an     264    HOW BENNIE DID IT. earnest feeling of sympathy, while her heart almost compelled her to say that she would be a daughter to him. "I think I would be very proud if I had such a desirable little piece of furniture in my house," continued he, pleasantly, "and would be a very kind and indulgent papa " "And I expect," she answered, 'that there are very many little girls in the world who would be happy enough if they had a kind and indulgent papa." TProbably the thought just then came sadly to her little heart that she had one once; for Mr. Wilsonl quickly noticed that a tear dropped upon her cheek. "Then it may not be a bad idea," said Mr. Wilson, as he caressingly forced his fingers through her profuse curls, "for me to look about, and see how many such little girls I can find 'to whom I can be the- next thing to their' own loving papas. Suppose I should com- mence with yourself, and then continue the work by adding your sister Nettie; after which,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    265 by way of variety, include also Master Willie here; for you must know that I have never had a son either." Nenie smiled one of the peculiar little smiles so- natural to her when seized with a new and pleasant idea; and Mrs. Lisle turned upon the child a look which seemed expressive of fear that her daughter was to be taken from her at once. "I do n't know about that," said Nenie with an air of consideration; " it will probably be better that you know us all a little more before you become a papa to us; you might be very sorry that you had done so after becoming bet- ter acquainted." "Pretty sensible suggestion that, Miss Nenie," replied Mr. Wilson pleasantly. "Well, if you 'll let me come and see you sometimes, so that we can get acquainted with each other, we can by degrees obtain the desired information; and if we are mutually satisfied, my proposal ean be renewed. In the mean time, I hope you   266     HOW BENNIE DID IT. will try and love me, for indeed I feel as though I could soon love you very much." It was not Nenie alone who was giving ear- nest attention to what Mr. Wilson was saying, for her sister and brother were evidently doing the same thing.- The dear little fatherless ones had by degrees drawn about his knee, Willie with a hand resting confidingly thereon, and Nettie, almost unknown to herself, was leaning upon the shoulder opposite to the one occupied by Nenie, and was looking up into the fatherly face with the earnest expression of a newly kindled hope that was shaping up for her young heart new treasures of joy. Mr. Wilson was quick enough to perceive that his sympathy and kindness were surely wending their way into the hearts of the chil- dren, at least, and he was delighted at the thought. So encircling the little trio in his arms, he drew the children to him with a peculiar tenderness of feeling that he had rarely had the pleasure of knowing. And as   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     267 the widow looked upon the little group, there rose within her heart emotions of gratitude to God, for she felt indeed that, He was pro- viding for her children a friend. In the mean time, Bennie had been sitting by, apparently having but little to do with the de- velopments in the case. But he was of course closely observing what the developments were, and was very happy as he noticed the mutual interest that was created between the family and Mr. Wilson. It is not necessary, to say to what extent Bennie had in his own mind planned the bringing about of the results that were even thus far accomplished; but there can be no doubt that he had contemplated much more than merely bringing Mr. Wilson to the family to furnish-them temporary relief. In some respects he knew Mr. Wilson better than Mr. Wilson knew himself, and was al- ready foreseeing the happiest results from the visit S And when it was time for the gentle- men to leave, it would have been a hard ques- tion to decide which was the happiest party   268    HOW BENNIE DID IT. of the company, the widow, the children, Mr. Wilson, or Bennie. The whole family were quite reluctant to have the visitors leave, and were very cordial in their requests that the visit should soon be -repeated. To say that Mr. Wilson, with a manner the most delicate, left abundant means for all present wants would be to say what the reader would of course naturally suppose. As to what he proposed further to do, he kept his own counsel and said nothing. But one thing may be mentioned, viz: that the next morning a carman came to Mrs. Lisle's door with a well assorted load of groceries and other family necessities, among which, last, though not least, we may say, was found a barrel of 4X Netump- sick flour! And on that same morning Mr. Wilson and Bennie were together as usual, transacting until a late hour the current business of the day without any allusion having been made to the events of the evening preceding. Before noon, however, Mr. Wilson had addressed the follow-   BOW BENNIE DID IT.      269 ing note to the different houses which had been parties with him in the "combination." "Q-,     -18-, "MESSRS. ----  Gentlemen '- You are herewith notified that for iea- sons entirely satisfactory to myself I shall at twelve o'clock to-morrow withdraw from the " combination" in Netumpsick flour, making no sales in the mean time; but at the hour named resuming sales to consumers only, and reducing the price to ten dollars per barrel. This circular is issued that parties to the " combina- tion" who are holding the flour may have time to shape their operations accordingly. "Respectfully, "GEORGE WILSON." After Mr. Wilson had sent copies of the cir- cular to the parties with whom he had been committed in the "combination," he called Ben- nie to his desk, and handed a copy to him, with the remark that after he had read it he should communicate its instructions to the  salesmen throughout the house. Much to the astonishment of Mr. Wilson,  .         .   270    HOW BENNIE DID IT. Bennie read the circular with as little evidence of surprise as though its contents were to him an announcnment entirely expected. "It gives me much pleasure, Mr. Wilson," said he, " to read this." "But in one respect I am disappointed in your manner of receiving it," said Mr. Wilson. "And what is that?" asked Bennie. "You exhibited no surprise that I should have taken such a step," answered Mr. Wilson. "Because I felt none," was the ready reply. "I anticipated some such action on your part as this." "Did you, indeed?" exclaimed Mr. Wilson, with an astonishment which he was unable to control. "I would much like to know why you had any such anticipation?" "Well, sir," replied Bennie, respectfully, " in  the first place, my view of this whole flour movement, from its very commencement, was that it was wrong; and I believed that, sooner or later, you would look upon it the same ;a', at which time, I felt confident you would quick'   BOW BENNIVE DID IT.    271 disconnect yourself from it. Since the 'combi- nation' has been in force, one or two circum- stances have transpired which convinced me that you were not satisfied with the connec- tion. And the conversation yesterday at Mrs. Lisle's was to me conclusive that this very procedure, or something similar, would be the result at an early day. And I hope you will excuse me for saying that, in my own mind, I have done you the justice to believe that at heart you have no sympathy with any such transactions." "Then how, in this case, could you have regarded me in any other light than as a rene- gade from principle?" asked Mr, Wilson. "When you committed yourself to it, sir," an- swered Bennie, with the deferential manner that had always claimed his employer's admiration, "the principle involved was so obscured by the rubbish of speculation that you could not see it. At that point, you were like the uncon- victed sinner, who has never seen his condition, both by nature and practice, in the light of   272    HO W BENNIE DID IT. God; but when that light is flashed into his mind and conscience, he is startled, and sees, with wonder and surprise, what he never saw before. This I knew to be your condition in this whole transaction; but I have been cournfi- dent that you would come to the light." 4 Why did you not express your opinio:n to me before matters progressed as far as they have?" asked Mr. Wilson. "I thinlk your own knowledge of me will enable you to answer that question yourself, sir," answered Bennlie. "Yes, my dear boy," exclaimed Mr. Wilson, quickly, as he extended his hland to Bennie, and his voice trembled with emotion; "I can answer it. You have ever been respectful to me, and never intrusive or impertinent. But I do n't know but in this instance you have been too careful, and ought, instead, to have considered it your duty to have approached me with your- protest against a transaction that had in it so much that was wrong. And now, from this day forth, remember that to me you sustain a   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    273 new relation, even that of confidant, friend and adviser; and as, both in judgment and heart, you have given me so many evidences of special integrity and capacity, I now commission and request you that you will talk with me hence- forward on any and all points as you would to your father, giving you the promise that not even by your father shall you ever be more kindly received." Bennie's heart was so full that he hardly knew how to reply. With whatever peculiari- ties, or even wrong there was in Mr. Wilson, the youthitruly respected and loved him; and indeed he had reason, for he had received only friendship and kindness from the merchant from the first day that he entered his employ. This, 't is true, was what Mr. Wilson bestowed in general upon all who were in his service; but Bennie's own conduct was the moving spring that had drawn out from his employer a special consideration which others had not similarly exerted themselves to obtain. The labor had secured its own reward; nevertheless, Bennie, 18   274    HOW BENNIE DID IT. without resting on any merit of -his own in the case, was simply disposed to accord full ac- knowledgment of his employer's unabated kind- ness to him. "I thank you indeed, Mr. Wilson," was his reply, "for your generous expression of regard, as well as the position of confidence to which you invite me; and it would be a baseness of ingratitude in me, were I not here to express my warmest thanks for the, unceasing favor I have ever received at your hands. So happy have I been since in your service that the review of my business life is simply delightful. But it is to yourself that I look instrumentally, as the main cause; and there has always been for me a stimulus to faithful labor, in that I have ever felt that my efforts were appreciated by you."  "And I can assure you," said Mr. Wilson, "that to whatever extent 1 may have expressed my. appreciation of your service, I have felt more than I have expressed. Probably I have restrained mvself in this respect too much, but   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     275 I have done so under the conviction that an employee may be as surely spoiled by excess of praise and intimacy on the part of his em- ployer as by a stern and exacting demeanor. If I am not mistaken, there is a passage some- where in the Bible which says, that 'he that delicately bringeth up his servant shall after a time have him for his son.'T" u And all experience, I doubt not, will justify the assertion," replied Bennie. "But I am very far from complaining, in the slightest re. spect, as to your deportment towards me." "As to this (combination,'" said .Mr. Wilson, suddenlychanging  the subject, I regret on some accounts that I have had any connection with it. True, it was a business matter, and such an one as is continually recognized as proper enough in the general light of commer- cial enterprise. But you were correct in your opinion that I have not beenentirely satisfied since light broke in and I began to consider it in a  moral and Christian aspect. It was a transaction for which there was no justification;   276     HOW BENNIE DID IT. in its very conception, a panic was covertly de- signed. There was no outside demand to make the flour either scarce or high; consequently the controlling feature of'supply and demand' was not in real force to establish the right of advance in price, for the supply was ample, and the demand was forced. However, apart 'from the suffering that it has caused tothe poor, I am glad of the affair to this extent, that it has been to me an advantage in enabling me to discover a principle which has hitherto been obscure to my vision; and I can henceforth not only keep myself from any participation in like transactions, but can use my influence to have them suppressed." "'You will probably have a battle to fight in consequence of this circular," suggested Bennie; "it is not to be doubted that the other parties to the 'combination' will denounce' the step you have taken." "That I certainly expect," replied Mr. Wil- son, "but I have little fear in that respect if I can only master myself."   HOW BENNIE  DID IT.    2" "How so, sir?" asked Bennie. "Well, the fact is, that I am in no very ami. able mood towards any of them, in that they involved me in the affair; and my fear is, that I may not be able to control myself as I would wish." (' Was your assent to the 'combination' less your fault than theirs, Mr. Wilson?" asked Bennie, rather diffidently. "Probably not," replied Mr. Wilson; "but as I am confident that the thing would not have originated with me, I feel that the wrong is doubly theirs, first in its conception, and next in drawing me into it. And while I do not pretend entirelyto exculpate myself, I can- not restrain the feeling of more severely hand- ling them." A quick reply came to Be nie's tongue, but' he did not think it advisable to use his new. pledged "commission " too freely, and so with. held what he would have said. But Mr. Wil, son's eye was quick/to notice the suppressed remark.      / Out with what ;ou would say, my boy," he   278    HOW BENNIE DID IT. exclaimed; "whatever it is, I will receive it kindly." "Thank you, sir," replied Bennie; " my sug- gestion would have been, that in the event of any conflict with these parties, you will have an excellent opportunity for the exhibition of a Christian spirit." "How?"  "By a kindly confession that the whole thing was a great wrong, and by severely censuring yourself that you did not see it in the com- mencement, and then have endeavored to dis- suade them from it."  "But how can a man who is no Christian do a Christian action?" asked Mr. Wilson. "'GOD helps all who ask him," answered Bennie. "Well, I do n't know but He does," said the merchant, dropping his head and sitting for a moment lost in thought; " but then," added he, quickly regaining' himself, "why should I cen- sure; myself for not seeing the 'wrong in the commencement when I did n't see it?"  "The probability -is," answered Bennie, s   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     279 "that you didn't want to see it, because it was at that moment so much more agreeable to contemplate the speculation in prospect." "I do n't know that I have a miserly greed for money," interposed Mr. Wilson with a little rising of impatience. "No, sir, I can truly attest that you have not; but you have, in common with others, a vigorous purpose for successful business push- ing which is not prone to stand for a moment, and thoroughly sift the right and wrong of everything that offers." Mr. Wilson was amazed that such discrim- inating ideas as these could come from such a youthful mind, for they fell upon him with a power that was irresistible, and made him feel as though he was just witnessing the dawning of a new day. So again he dropped his head, and gave to the suggestions of his young teacher an earnest consideration. ' Bennie did not dis' him for a little while, but after a few moments drew nearer and gently laid his hand upon his employer's shoul.   280    HOW BENNIE DID IT. der. Mr. Wilson quickly looked up, and noticed that the eyes of his clerk were suffused with tears. "Mr. Wilson," said Bennie, with a tone that was full of emotion, " may I add a word or two more to what I have said?" "Yes, yes, my boy, add anything and every- thing that you wish," exclaimed Mr. Wilson, deeply touched; "for I feel as teachable as a child to-day, and I know there can be nothing you will say to which I will not at once and heartily respond." "This I would say," said Bennie. "If on the day that you entered into that,' combination ' you had sought counsel of God, through Christ His Son, for guidance and for a clear perception with which you might be able to discern actions as to their principles and results, He doubtless would have enabled you to reflect, and see the transaction apart from the blinding influence of speculation. And now, were you daily to I acknowledge Him in all your ways, and con- tinually to seek and rest upon Him by faith,   B-HOW BENNIE DID IT.    281 you would experience an abiding help to which you have been a stranger." "But have I not been prosperous in business without having specially done as you suggest?" asked Mr. Wilson. "True, you have," answered Bennie, "but it may have been at the expense of your heart's hardening. - You were greatly successful in this 'combination,' but has the success brought hap- piness and peace to your conscience and. soul? A mere money prosperity may be more a curse than a blessing, and it would be a very unsafe conclusion for any of us to make, that because we are successful in our earthly schemes it is because we are favorites of God. The very reverse is no doubt often the truth." "I presume you are correct," replied Mr. Wilson; " for heaven must be essentially unlike earth, and consequently all that binds nus more closely to the latter must only lessen our hold on the former; but it is a hard lesson to learn, this being on the earth but yet living in heart and practice above it."   282    HOW BENNIE DID IT. As Mr. Wilson finished this remark, two gen. tlemen of the " combination " entered the office, and Bennie retired. Before doing so, however, he had time to notice that the visitors were in no pleasant mood, and also that Mr. Wilson was quick to assume a manner as defiant as theirs was hostile. It was but the work of a moment for Bennie to step to his desk and write this text: "A soft answer turneth away wrath." - Prov. 15: 1. Quickly enclosing the slip of paper in an envelope, he bade a boy go immediately and hand it to Mr. Wilson without awaiting a reply. All was done in so short time that the gentle- men had as yet hardly announced the special object of their visit. As quick as thought, when the envelope was handed to Mr. Wilson, did he recognize Bennie's handwriting, the effect of which was to produce in his mind a prepara- tion for what he was-to read. And the result was most happy; for yielding at once to the injunction of the text, the merchant was imme- 1    "BOW BENNIE DID IT.    283 diately sensible of a' calmed and conciliatory feeling which enabled him to turn to his visitors so kindly as to check the recriminative feeling with which he had purposed to meet them. "We have received your circular, Mr. Wil- son," said one of the visitors, Mr. Hawley, "and were so very much surprised at its contents that we have not delayed a moment in coming to see you in reference thereto." "I am glad you have done so," replied Mr. Wilson, with unaffected pleasantness ;" "and I don't know, on reflection, but that it was my duty to have called on you with my explanation instead of awaiting you, for the neglect of which propriety I tender my apology." "To be candid with you, Mr. Wilson," inter- posed Mr. Simpkins, "Mr. Hawley and myself had thought you would have come, as you have suggested, but at any rate your apology is ac- cepted." If Mr. Simpkins had been in an unpleasant mood when he entered the office that feeling was evidently dissipated now, and   284    HOW BENNIE DID IT. probably in consequence of the pleasant man. ner of Mr. Wilson. "Thank you," replied Mr. Wilson; "with reference to the announcement contained in my circular, I made it because of a conscientious conviction that our ' combination' was a wrong; and believing thus, I felt it duty to withdraw from it, after giving those with whom I was committed sufficient time to make such disposal of their stock as they would think was best. I am aware, gentlemen, that on mere commercial principles my action may expose me to severe criticism, but to this I must submit with the best grace possible." "Wherein is the wrong?" asked Mr. Haw- ley. "In that we have forced one of the simplest necessities of life to an unparalleled price, such as is an oppression upon the poor, and for -which there was no adequate reason!" replied Mr. Wilson, with a firm, though conciliatory tone.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     285 "If we have done wrong, Mr. Wilson," said Mr. Hawley, '"then thousands Of mercantile and other oierations, as continually practised upon us as well as others, are just as wrong, and yet are apparently inseparable from the working of the general business machinery of any com- munity." "Wrong they may be, friend Hawley," re- plied Mr. Wilson; "but did ever yet two wrongs make one right?" "Do you really know of any who have been oppressed, or to whom serious embarrassment has come in this case, Mr. Wilson?" asked Mr. Simpkins.  "Through my own customers I have been more particularly made acquainted with the  severity of the thing, as they, in retailing, are brought into immediate contact with the con- sumers as we are not." "And what have you learned from any of them which would establish the fact that con- sumers were really oppressed?" "This," answered Mr. Wilson, decidedly,   286    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "that there are those, who, with an income so small tlat under the most favorable cir- cumstances it only enables them by economy to support their families, have been compelled not only to use cheaper flour, but to abridge the quantity of their bread!" "Oh," replied Mr. Simpidns, with a -smile and a toss of his head, " such cases as that are always occurring, no matter how prosperous the times may be; but they are only excep- tional cases, and cannot with any propriety be quoted here, I think, in support of your idea." "Friend Simpkins," said Mr. Wilson, "I hope you will believe me' when I tell you that I have taken pains to inquire into particu- lars as resulting from this very case, and am not acting under the impulse of a whim. When my attention was first called to the matter, the thought that I had any special moral responsi. bility about it seemed simply absurd. Was not the whole thing a business transaction? A speculation tis true .it was, but are we   OW BENNIE DID IT.     287 not speculating, in one sense, all the time? Was n't it an every-day affair? Have I not the right all the time to employ my capital in any way that will make it yield gobd return, especially in trading in such a substantial and legitimate article, as flour? And if my mer. cantile sagacity enables me to see a certain profit in a given placing of my capital, will not the operation be entirely in the line of my business, and justly entitled to its reward? Were I in- vesting in lottery-tickets, prize-schemes, western swamp town-lots, inflating or depressing stocks around a stock-board, etc. etc., the case might be different. All these were questions 'which at first made our case to me entirely justifiable; but a day or two's investigation, made with an earnest purpose to ascertain what was thor- oughly and morally the right, opened my eyes to an understanding that my mere selfish pur- poses made me answerable for the ill results that might follow." "Hah, hhh," laughed Mr. Simpkins, rather abruptly interrupting Mr. Wilson, " you must pbJ U"UI1Uurf  u  rsul   288    HOW BENNLE DID IT. have been reading after some of the oldI crack- brained moralists whom I could name, whose ideas if practised would- stop all business proceedings, put everybody on a level, and allow no man at sundown to hold a dollar more than his neighibor I Please, friend Wil- son, let me ask a question." "Certainly, ask a dozen if you wish." "Thank you. You are a ship-owner?" Yes." "And sail your vessels to and fro, laden with -merchandise and people?" "Yes." "For what purpose?" "To make money." "A candid confession. You- are not con- scious, then, that it is from any particularly benevolent purpose that you are engaged in such business?" "No, sir." "Well, we may qualify the purpose in your mind thus far, that as a feature of business you have a taste for ship-stock, and choose to invest i    , , '   I-HOW BENNIE DID IT.    289 in it; but mainly, your purpose is to make- money. Now suppose that one of your good ships puts to sea with a large list of passengers and a goodly cargo, and the whole thing, ship, cargo and people, is lost; on your basis, are you not morally responsible for the lives of the people?" "No, sir." Both the visitors laughed outright; but Mr. Wilson sat complacently permitting them to enjoy their laugh to their heart's content, and- not in the least degree apprehensive concern- ing the security of his position. "Are not the cases parallel, Mr. Wilson,?" asked Mr. Simpkins, when his amusement was checked. "Not at all," calmly replied the merchant. "Please explain." "Yes, sir. I said in reply to your question that I would not be responsible for the lives of the lost passengers. This I may modify so far as to admit that if my vessel was wrecked as a consequence of negligent or insufficient 19   290    HOW BENNIE DID IT. outfit, I would of course be responsible. But if she sailed under the accustomed advantages, I, as her owner, would only be employing her and my capital in a way indispensable to carrying and travelling interests, and without making her an  instrument with which to extort from a given hundred or two of people their last dollars, and so aid in increasing the measure of their distress. The loss of the vessel thus being a casualty which I could not possibly foresee, and not being brought about as the inevitable result of a wilful or at' least sordid purpose that had no reference to the suffering of others provided my own greed was satisfied, there could certainly be no respon- sibility devolved upon me in connection with it. But when you and I lay hands, avariciously, upon the entire stock of an article of food, and it bread, because we see that our money will enable us to control and enhance it to an ex- tent that will actually make it a burden on the poor, then, gentlemen, 1 hold that you and I are   1O W BENNIE DID IT.    291 enemies to the community in which we live, and are responsible for the distress we create." By the time Mr. Wilson was through, the derisive smile that had been on the faces of his visitors had vanished. By some rapid change of thought Mr. Simpkins had begun to see that Mr. Wilson had set matters in a different light. He, too, was waking. True he made no preten- sions to be a man given to a specially refined code of morals, was in fact "a man of the, world " whose creed, commercially, was short --"get motley":- nevertheless, -he could- see that the case, as thus set, opened to him a vision of obligation upon which he was not toO close his eyes. Thought: quickly conceived thought, until, like the unseen host which burst upon the sight of the young man at the prayer of Elisha, he seemed to be surrounded with newhorn ideas of relationship to his fellow-man that compassed all his transactions, and required that they be weighed in the scale of love to his neighbor! e      292     EO0 W BENiNIE DID IT. "What say you, Mr. Simpkins," continued Mr. Wilson; "have I ' a ,case,' as the lawyers say, or not?" ," Well, I do n't know, friend Wilson, but that what you have said is worth thinking about at least; and I admit that the lost ship, and the Netumpsick at fifteen dollars a barrel, don't exactly look like parallel cases, put them as they are. It does indeed seem as though there was a moral impropriety in such a movement as this in which we are engaged; and greatly to my own surprise, I assure you, I can see a differ- ence between such operations and others in which we engage. But really I fear it will take some time to educate myself to the point of a just discrimination in all future business mat. ters, and the thought is embarrassing. It is a position, I should think, where a man may grow morbid and become unfit for the common-sense details of life." "To a certain extent you are correct, Mr. Simpkins; but I imagine that when we come to the point where we are determined that we will   HOW"BENNIE DID IT.    293 engage in nothing that will not stand the test of Christian principle, we need not fear the dan- ger you suggest." "' That 's so," interposed Mr. Hawley, with a half-sneer, " and as we three are such a remark- * ably Christian trio, it's safe to suppose that we wont do any more naughty things for a good while to come.  But seriously, Mr. Wilson, whence do you propose that we are to import this necessary stock of Christian principle that is to make us such paragons of business consist- ency?" !"make no pretensions in this matter, Mr. Hawley," replied Mr. Wilson, " and am indeed but an elementary scholar myself.  To this" point I have come, viz., that in the 'combi- nation' in which we have been engaged we have been, doing a wrong; 'therefore I have determined to be done with it. As to future matters, I expect to find the light by seeking it; for I believe such cases to be exactly within the range of the promise: 'he that seeketh find- eth; and to -him that knocketh it shall be opened.' "   294    HO W BE'NNIE DID IT. "Your quotation is certainly one of good authority," said Mr. Simpklns, "and where properly believed is most encouraging." "So it is, and well commends itself to our most earnest efforts; for while we may go for- ward in our business engagements, having a money purpose, and a money success which may be a gratification of its kind, there must be an incomparably greater pleasure in suc- cesses which are seasoned by the movings of an enlightened conscience. There is a possibility even, as you suggested a moment ago, that we may become morbid and absurd: but it is cer- tainly better that a man should be so straight- laced as to lean backward than that he should bend to that which would in the slightest degree do his neighbor harm." "Very well, Mr. Wilson," interposed Mr. Hawley good-naturedly, "dropping the meta- physical, what do you propose to do with the Netumpsick side of the question?" "My circular indicates what I propose to do with it," replied Mr. Wilson. "And is that all?"   ITHOW BENNIE DID IT.    29b Mr. Wilson looked at the questioner with unmingled surprise. "All!" repeated he, "Yes: what more can I do?" "I intend doing what you propose and more too," replied Mr. Hawley. "What?" was the quick demand. "Well, I may say that I am more or less a convert to your doctrine; and I will not only join you at once in reducing prices, but will put a hundred barrels at the disposal of any person or benevolent agency which will take the trouble to ascertain where there are any poor who have suffered at our hands and make up to them, with interest, all their loss." "And I'll -add a hundred for the same pur- pose," said M3r. Simpkins, promptly. "I confess, gentlemen, that you have even outstripped me in the race, and have a position to which I had not advanced," said Mr. Wilson. ("And indeed, It am glad of it, and will not only add my hundred barrels to yours, but as many more as may be necessary to accomplish what   296    IIOW BENNIE DID IT. you have proposed. Within the past twenty four hours I have been made acquainted with a case which has fully satisfied me that there must be many who have really suffered, not perhaps to starvation, but in being compelled to shorten the amount of bread usually sup- plied. And so far as we are concerned, look- ing at our responsibilities in the case, we are. as culpable as though these poor had really come to starving. I had therefore determined quietly to do what I could, beginning with this case, and continuing with others of which I could learn, and use my flour money, or its late profits, in relieving need." *    e    *    * So out of the original "combination," thus dissolved, there came a new one founded in a benevolence and philanthropy that not only looked to undoing the evil of its predecessor, but to an active co-operation in improving the tone of operations for the future. And it may well be imagined that when the news of this day's work in the counting-room   HOW BENNIE DID IT.      297 of Mr. Wilson became known, and the poor, to whom bread was now a serious question, learned that flour had by one stroke come down to the level of their means, there was a shout of thanksgiving that rang throughout the city, such as had not been heard for many a day. I  #X      . j  I               -   CHrAPTER XI, BENNIE'S absence from the. house of the LISLES was short, scarce forty-eight hours intervening. And as he drew near to their home on the evening of the second day, he did so with feelings of pleasurable anticipation. Is there not always a special pleasure in announc- ing one's self where we are confident of wel- come? And well enough did Bennie know that welcome awaited him at the LISLES. But there was something else awaiting him there of which he did 't know. Oh, how his young heart, in its life-warmth contrasting with the wintry chill without, was beating with the pul- sations of benevolent work and joy; and how different his experience of pleasure from that of the mere self-seeker whose ideas of enjoy-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     299 ment have no connection with sacrificing self for another's good.

Nor in some respects is it necessary. Nevertheless, it is a matter in which we are all more interested than we are in any mere earthly gettings, be they either pleasures or treasures. It is well enough, however, to say that a per. son may h^ave general ideas of well-doing, and in the main may do what is well and right, so far as he may know what right is, and after all may love neither God nor his neighbor as com- manded  by our blessed teacher, Jesus. A man may be a good citizen, in many respects, and yet be an infidel! But love to God and love to our neighbor is a work both of the mind and the affections, which when in exercise in any human being stimulates and disposes him to well-doing by the purest motives; and while on this point we would- use the occasion by making earnest inquiry of the reader, "Do YOU love God, And do YOU believe on Him whom He   hath sent?" This question we ask, we trust, because we love you as 'our neighbor,' and because we desire that you should love God,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     301 and thus have within you the spring of all hap- piness for yourself and all with whom you may have to do. It was the fairy little NENIE herself who answered the bell, and met BENNIE at the door. Her bright face grew even brighter when she saw him; and it was so natural thus at home to receive the loving reception of those who there met him, that almost before he was aware of what he was doing he drew the sweet child to him with a kiss as brotherly and earnest as the little maiden could have wished. "Mamma has a new visitor," said she, " and a very nice one too." l Aha, I'm glad of it ;but what do you mean by 'a very nice one'?" "Well, she's very pretty and very sweet, and talks so kind that I love her already." ("The visitor is a lady, then?" said Bennie. "Yes, a young lady, and so beautiful." Bennie smiled at the child's enthusiasm, and  s   302    HiO } BENNIE DID IT. at the same time debated within himself as to the propriety of going up while the " beautiful visitor" was there. ' Probably I had better call again," said he. "Oh, no, no, mamma would be too much dis- appointed to know that you had come to the door, and then gone away. And I am certain, too, that the young lady would feel unpleasantly at the thought that she had prevented you from coming to see mamma." "What is the lady's name?"he asked. "Indeed, I do n't know." "Well, that's a little strange I Did she say nothing about herself or her name, or why she called, to your mamma, when she first came?" "She only said that a friend had spoken to her of us, and she was very glad he had, for we are in her ' visiting district,' as she called it, which made her feel an especial interest in coming to see us." "And did n't tell you her name?" No."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     303 "Very well, let's go up and see your mamma, and may be we'll find cut something more about this beautiful young lady." It was a kind of bewildering surprise that Bennie experienced when Nenie opened the door of her mamma's room for him to enter; for he was greeted not only with the cordial wel- come of Mrs. Lisle, but by the clear ringing laugh of his joyous and intimate young friend, MARY NORTON 1 Nenie had made no mistake in speaking to Bennie of her mamma's visitor as she did, for the beauty of Mary Norton was a fact that was beyond dispute, and there was no eye that once looked upon the face of the lovely girl but longed to look again. And, singular though it may seem, between her and 'the loving little Nenie there was a resemblance that was most marked, and which, by the way, had acted upon the child's mother like a spell; for over and over the question went through her mind, "' how can it be, without relationship, that such an astonishing resemblance can exist?" Was it   304    HOW BENNIE DID IT. not her own Nenie's eye, in form, color, ex- pression, and beamings of love that looked into hers? Was not the mouth, in its cast, and its every motion so indicative of purity and pur- pose, her Nenie's? Were -not the blendings of the carnation and the lily just those which tinged, as by an artist's hand, the cheek of herl beloved child?  And over the same -model forehead were not kindred flaxen clusters but ever ready to escape their confinement and make more beautiful the delicate cheek be- neath? Surely all were Nenie's, and why? "Mary Norton!" exclaimed Bennie, so full of astonishment as almost to forget that any one else was present, " can it be possible?" "'And why not possible?" asked she, ex- tending her hand and enjoying his surprise; "do all the pleasant acquaintanceships belong so much to Master Bennie Stout that his hum- ble friend Mary Norton may not also seek and enjoy them?" "My humble friend Mary Norton may rest assured that she is more than welcome to enjoy   HOW BENlNIE DID IT.     305 with me every good work," said he, recovering himself; " but indeed, although I had hoped to see you here sometime, I was not expecting it to-day. But Mrs. Lisle must excuse me for the forgetfulness of herself which for the moment this surprise has occasioned; and as Nenie has told me that as yet- you have no formal acquain- tance with my friend, Miss Mary Norton, please let me introduce her." Miss Norton sealed the introduction with a kiss as affectionate as though it had been given by a loving daughter, and which went to the heart of the widow with a depth of sympathy that in itself was comfort and strength. "Herself alone is introduction and recom-. mendatiou too," said Mrs. Lisle, gracefully seat- ing the young visitors, " but as your friend, Mr. Stout, the acquaintance is additionally delight- ful; and I must say that this is one of the most pleasant little episodes that I have enjoyedfor a long time. Miss Norton, I think, must have a tact for enjoyable little surprises." "So she has," replied Bennie with an amused 20   HOW BENNIE DID IT. air, " as well as for others that are not so enjoy- able. For the latter, however, I can say that we have abundant reason for being lenient with her; the fountains of mischief are not more easily to be stayed than those of the streamlet, and will one way or another have their flow." "It is doubtless true," replied Mrs. Lisle, "that what the sweet spring in the desert is to the parched traveller, so often are the springs of mirth to the careworn traveller in the journey of life; we may therefore be thankful that there are those to whom God gives the blessing of a cheerful spirit, for the influence thereof is most truly refreshing, as I can truly attest." "You know the experiences of a sad heart, Mrs. Lisle, do you?" asked Miss Norton. "Ah yes," was the reply, "I do indeed." And has the complaint become chronic?" The widow was almost startled at the ques- tion, for to her both the question and the tone in which it was put savored of heartlessness; and she turned to her young visitor with a look of wonder.   "You are surprised, I see, at my question," said Miss Norton, with a smile. "4 To some extent I may say that I was,' re- plied the widow; "but a little consideration makes me believe that I can see why you pro- posed it." "I cannot doubt that you do truly under- stand the why of my question. It is a delight- ful and sustaining thought that great numbers of the sad experiences to which we are sub- jected in this life are not necessarily permanent. We often act as though we would like to make them so, by turning them over and over in the mind until they bid fair not only to be perpe- tuated but increased. A Christian heart cer-  tainly has the right to be a cheerful heart, and it is a question whether we do not often com- mit wrong in yielding to grief. Affliction and trial are more or less inseparable from our very existence here, but there is a grace which we may receive that tempers an affliction to a chastening, which, when truly recognized, makes     308    HOW BENNIE DID IT. the birds again to sing, and everything about us to rejoice." Miss Norton paused, probably because just here, in turning towards Bennie, she noticed that his face was overspread with a kind of incredulous smile. "Your countenance expresses some doubt, Master Bennie, as to the truth of what I say," said she. "Does it? You may believe me -then that it does me injustice." ' Then why the smile?" "Well, I was thinking how very easy it is to theorize as to the uses and abuses of affliction when by experience we know nothing about them." "Then, after all, you were doubtful as to mine being a correct position?" "Indeed I was not!" "What then?" "Well, in the first place, I believe all you said to be true: and next I believe that you   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     309 believe every word you spoke. But at the same time I could not help thinking of the great difference, even for instance in your case, between knowing affliction and trouble, and merely knowing of it. Can't you suppose that you may go to the house of mourning and there offer and even feel all the sympathy of which a truly sympathizing nature is capable, and after all know nothing about the bitterness of the grief you witness?" "Certainly I can.  But is that any reason why I should not offer my sympathy in all cases of affliction?" Bennie smiled again. "No indeed, my friend Mary; nor did I in- tend to intimate any such thing." "Then would you object to my remarks as to one's deportment under affliction, and the efforts to be employed that it be not allowed to weigh us down?" "Not that either. The fact is, I was wonder. ing, good and unquestionable as your arguments were, what in Mrs. Lisle's mind would be the i      A.   310    HOW BENNIE DID IT. effect, coming from the source they did. Each of you is the representative of the contrary side of the question. She knows affliction, you know of it. And while I doubt not that her own Christian faith teaches her as to the cor- rectness of all you said, I think it must have almost excited within her the thought, 'dear child, she talks truthfully, feelingly, and beauti- fully: but oh, how high have the billows of grief yet to roll over her before she can in the true light appreciate what she says.'" Miss Norton looked discouraged, but Mrs. Lisle and Bennie were both quick to under- stand her thoughts. "I can sustain you both," said Mrs. Lisle, cheerfully. "And Miss Norton I can truly en- courage; for while it is true that I did have the passing idea somewhat as suggested by Mr. Stout, there was nevertheless a- sure conscious- ness of comforting strength that came to me with her every remark. And this I will add in connection with my expression of gratitude to her, that I am confident she said nothing which   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     3" her heart did not prompt; and it was this con- viction which gave to her words the power for good." "Well," replied Miss Norton, her bright face again beaming with its accustomed smile, "I thank you, after all, master Bennie, for your interruption. To be the almoner of blessing and sympathy, I think I can say without affec- tation, is to me an inexpressible pleasure, and I hope that God will use me continually in lightening the burden of many an aching heart. What has just been said I believe will dispose me the deeper to analyze my motives and sym-  pathies, that they may be brought into true re-, lation with realities, and thus made capable of more effective work." Without being hardly aware of what she was doing, the hand of the widow involuntarily sought and clasped that of the lovely speaker, while her eyes filled with tears that seemed as- it were welling up from the depths of a relieved and comforted heart.   312     HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Ah, my dear child," said she, " with such a spirit and purpose, how confidently you may pray for assistance -in your efforts. You are indeed to be congratulated, for it is :unhappily too rare in this world that the desires to do good are as ready as the opportunities; and what an unspeakable blessing it is when heart and hand are so consecrated to Christ and His servicethat the aim is not only to do, but to do well." Miss Norton was about to reply when she felt a movement at the side of her chair, and turning, she saw standing there-the little black- eyed WILLIE, who had entered quietly during the conversation. His mother's hand was still holding that of her young visitor, and the child interpreted the attitude as indicative of an intimacy of friendship, such as warranted his seeking acquaintance; and he sought it not long; for in a moment, Miss Norton, catching at once his wish, threw her arms about him and drew him most affectionately to her.   HO W BENNIE DID IT.    313 "You dear little black-eye," she exclaimed, well nigh transported with his sweet face, "why, who are you?" "WILLIE," he replied, with an irresistible art- lessness. "Willie I then you are the 'Sweet William' here I suppose; am I right?" ' I do n't know." "You do n't I well, who does?" "Mamma." "Aha," said his questioner, "it's not neces- sary to ask mamma about that, for I think I can easily imagine her reply. Well, I think I would like to love you very much. Are you willing?"2 "I am, if you will let me love you very much too." "Indeed, I'll make that bargain with you most gladly, and seal it too," said she. And she did seal it with an earnest kiss, which the little fellow reciprocated by so cordially throw. ing his arms about her neck as to assure her that he was fully- appreciative of her style of sealing a bargain.   814    HOW BENNIE DID IT. But if Miss Norton had any disposition for an exclusive holding of the affection of all the children,- a purpose, however, not likely to her unselfish nature,- she might well be jealous, for she could very plainly see -that Nenie clung strong and unshaken to Bennie. The child was delighted with their lady visitor, in fact was fast learning to love her; but. in relation to Bennie the lesson was already learned. And of course there was reason. For the circumstances under which she first met him, and the kindness then so opportunely bestowed, when to her little heart a gentle word was sweetness itself, all was too deeply graven on her affections to  be either effaced or supplanted. Naturally enough was it therefore delightful for her to be and remain near him, and to make but little demonstration towards any other while she could have him by her side. Sweet indepen- dence of childhood; what a privilege, in that it can love as it lists, and exhibit its love as it pleases, without being restrained by any anxe iety as to what others may think 1-   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     315 Bennie was greatly delighted, as well as somewhat surprised, when Mrs. Lisle informed him of the generous provision for the family wants that had been sent by Mr. Wilson. It was not, however, without an effort that the widow was able to conceal how sore, to her sensitive nature, was the-trial which made her and her little ones the necessary subjects for such benefaction. Nevertheless, she not only had the grace to recognize this as her " crook in the lot," but also to use it as a discipline for blessing, the end whereof, though knowing not now, she would surely know hereafter. The visit of Miss Norton and Bennie was in every respect a delightful and profitable one to all parties; and although the young lady, on this first acquaintance did not consider it proper that she should make very free inquiry as to the family's former history, she was nevertheless convinced that there was something special that was yet to be revealed. The tokens were too palpable that they were the children of affluence and refinement to be mistaken, and the Christian-   316     10 W BENNIE DID IT. hearted girl congratulated herself that she had made the acquaintance, anticipating from it as she did a peculiar pleasure in Mrs. Lisle's intelligent converse, as well as a luxury in the companionship, gratitude, and love of the children. So much had she enjoyed herself with the family, and so abundant and agreeable had been the flow of conversation, that it was not until the visit was about to be closed that Miss Nor- ton made known the principal feature in her I' district visitations." "You have told us," said she, "Mrs. Lisle, that since you have been in Q-- you have not enjoyed statedly the privileges of the sanc- tuary, and I of course infer that the children are not connected with a Sabbath School?" "You are correct," replied the mother, turn- ing towards her dear little ones with a sigh, "and it may be that pride has influenced me to do them wrong in this respect. Indeed, I fear I have thought more of their looks than their hearts; for because I have not been able to   HROW BElNNIE DID IT.    317 send them as I would, I have declined sending them as I could. But after all, 'circumstances alter cases,' anld there is, I think, in a mother's heart much that is excusable." "There can be no doubt of it,' replied Miss Norton, " although we Should be careful in all such cases as this, lest we presume farther than any excusable bounds. The spiritual interests are of too vast importance to allow any earthly consideration to prevent us from giving them the most diligent attention. I think, too, that it is an unsafe experiment in the training of chil- dren to permit irregularity in religious duty; for irregularity quickly begets indifference, from which can come the soul's ruin." It was not' to be doubted that in her heart Mrs. Lisle was convinced of these truths, al- though she made no reply except that which was expressed in her countenance. "And now, Mrs. Lisle," continued Miss Nor- ton, "unless you can plead an objection of which: I cannot conceive, I hope you will at   318    HOW BENNIE DID IT. once, even next Sabbath, give the children the advantage they have thus long been denied." At this suggestion the widow was startled, as at something for which. she was entirely unprepared. "I fear I can hardly have them ready," she replied. "Ready I then the old pride is not yet sub- dued?" "But would it be proper for me to subject them to the mortification which their appear- ance would occasion?" "They can be clean, can 't they?" "Yes; but " - she was afraid to say what.-- "May I answer for you?" "I have no doubt that you can," was the reply, "and I expect it is my duty to assent, even thankfully, too, that the opportunity is afforded, and leave the result with Him who knows at once my heart and my condition." "I am delighted with your reply," said Miss Norton, " and you may confidently expect that   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     319 your faith will not go unrewarded. With your permission, I will call for the children, if well, on Sabbath morning." "All of them?" "Certainly. Why except any?" "Is not Willie too young?" "Five years old, is he not?" "Yes; but is there any advantage in putting such little ones into the Sabbath School?" "Suppose we make him the judge. Willie, little darling, would you like to go to Sunday School?" a To your Sunday School?"  "Yes, to my Sunday School." "Are you the teacher?" "Yes, I am one of the teachers." (' Will you be my teacher?" "Yes, if you would like me to be." "Then I want to go, if mamma is willing,"  replied he, confidently nestling by her. ' Now, mamma, what say you?" "I shall make no objection, but instead will   320    HOW BENNIE DID IT. only express my thanks for the interest you manifest in us." "Indeed I am very glad," said Miss Norton, "and I have one other request to make, which is, that you will allow me to come to-morrow aind see if I can assist you in making such prepara- tion for the children as you would like." "Your offer is most kind, and one which the pleasure of your company would alone dispose me to accept. In the mean time I will use this evening in looking over their little wardrobes, scant though they have become, and see what there is that can be put into a condition that will be passable." About which Miss Norton had plans quickly formed of her own that she would work out at the proper time. During this conversation Bennie sat holding a hand each of Nenie and Nettie, the three maintaining a little chat of their own, which had now turned upon the same point with that of the ladies. "They don't seem to ask our opinion, or     HOW BENNIE DID IT.     321 consent, or assistance, or anything else con- nected with the interesting proposition, do they?" said he playfully. "Indeed they do n't," answered Nettie, affect- ing a little pout, " but I think they might." "And so do I," remarked Miss Norton, "but inasmuch as it was not done formally, suppose we consider that it was, and that all parties are agreed." "Agreed to what?" asked Nenie, with a pretty little feint of surprise. "That a flock of which I know is on next Sunday morning to have three dear little lambs added to it," replied Miss Norton, reaching her hands towards Nenie and Nettie, who, accept- ing the invitation, were together folded to her  heart. Resting thus within the embrace of their lovely young friend, she and they might have formed an artist's beau ideal for a picture; for they were truly the representation of a beauty and a grace of which earth could not present 21   322    HlOW BENNIE DID IT. a finer model; and when the affectionate little Willie wound himself into the tableau, artlessly developing the beauty of the whole, it appeared as though the finishing touch was applied. "Well," said Bennie; rising, "it's evident enough that Miss Norton is stealing you all away from me; so I had better bid you good evening." With a bound the children were all again by his side, showing plainly that the very thought of any one supplanting him in their affections would be absurd.   4 "All right," said he; '"I of course feel better now. Nevertheless, it is time that I was on my homeward way, and with Miss Norton's con- sent, I think the evening is sufficiently advanced for me to take her with me." "Thank you for your considerate care," re- plied she, rising, "I think so too. But indeed, I dislike much to break up an interview so pleasant as I have here enjoyed." "It would be useless," remarked Mrs. Lisle   HOW  BENN1E DID IT.        323 in reply, "for us to express our pleasure from your visit, as it must be sufficiently evident -to need no words." "May it be soon renewed," interposed Ben. nie; and with affectionate parting, the young visitors retired. -            C^ d              .               .   CHAPTER XII. THE visit of which we have just been giving an account has revealed to the reader the fact that Bennie Stout and Mary Norton were on terms of intimate friendship; and it may be that the question has arisen, "how is it that we have learned so much of Bennie during all this time without knowing that he had any acquaint- ance with the NORTONS except with the father?" To which we reply, that for the purpose in view in this story, there has been no need of intro- ducing characters any faster than we have; as we have only sought to bring them out at such times as present them in a practical connection with the history, and as illustrations of points of principle. The friendship between Bennie and Mary was not only intimate, but was of long stand-   HBO W BENNIE DID IT.    825 ing; and it was no small compliment to the former that such was the fact. There -were many reasons why a place in her friendship was specially desirable. Beautiful in person, lovely in character, possessed of a mind highly culti- vated and brilliant, the child of parents whose position was such that her entree into society would be all that a healthy ambition could de. sire, enjoying both health and wealth, and withal a Christian, one may well say that Bennie Stout might truly be'proud and happy- to know that Mary Norton was his friend. This, however, would not have been permitted, that is, to the extent it had reached, had he not also warm friends in both her father and mother. Mr. Norton was a, man whose genuine Christian character made him the friend of everybody. The poor he assisted, the wicked he sought to I reform, over the erring he was ready to cast the mantle of charity, and to the repentant i    grant forgiveness; but when he reached the point of companionship for his children, and admissions to the friendship of his home fireside, I    pito   opnosi    o i  hlrn  n   326    IIOW BENNIE DID IT. his discriminations were careful and emphatic. The merely rich in money received from him simply a money esteem; that was one thing; his frietdship and social intercourse were another; and these he only bestowed when the attractions were of the kind that met the yearn- ings of a heart that was renewed by the Spirit of God.  Nor was he assuming in his deci- sions, priding himself on his superior religious tone, and thus in self-righteous attitude de- nouncing others. It was not this at all. For the reasons thus stated, Bennie and Mary had been permitted to grow up together almost as brother and sister. She called him Bennie; he called her Mary. And this was because her father well knew that from this association his daughter would only be subjected to influences such as were established in right, and would be aids in forming her character for good, Nevertheless, during all this acquaintance, he was ever watchful, and ever aiding by counsel and example to establish within her mind and heart such principles for the conduct of life as   HiOW BENNIE DID IT.    327 would prove a barrier against the approaches of error, and make her a blessing in all her relations. He continually encouraged her, too, to come to him in every emergency, and thus by an affectionate interest in all that interested her so effectually secured her confidence and love that she was ever under his eye and his guidance. "I would like to know, Mary," said Bennie, as they walked homeward, "who told you of the LISLES?" "My father." "And who told him?" "Mr. Wilson." "So of course you knew of my acquaintauco with them." "Oh, yes," replied she, laughing, "and of your special devotion to the oldest daughter." "Aha; that being the case, do n't you com- mend my taste?" "I do, indeed."   328    HOW BENNIE DID IT. "To such an extent that you quickly con- ceived a similar devotion for her brother." "True enough; how very- susceptible we both are," she answered gaily; "but indeed who could help loving the darling little fellow, even on sight?" "Or, on sight, the darling little sister?" re- turned Bennie, quickly., Mary laughed at his repartee. "We may as well compromise the question," said she, "by admitting that the family is indeed a lovely one, and that all have captivated our hearts alike." "I think so; although it did really seem to me that master Willie made a rather more effective captivation than either of the others, judging from the kiss he received." "The happy hearted little darling," inter- posed Mary. "So I say," returned Bennie, expressively; "he had reason." Bonnets in those days shielded blushes,   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     329 otherwise even the evening shadows might not have prevented Bennie's noticing the deep glow that quickly overspread) the cheek, and even mounted to the temples, of his fair young friend. "I am delighted," said she, as if unaware of his last remark, "that their mother consented to their going with us to Sabbath School." 'She is a sensible woman," replied Bennie; "I have no doubt that it was quite an effort for her to consent, so sadly must their proba- ble appearance contrast with- what it must have been in former days." "Yes, indeed; it is one of the hard trials for her, we may well suppose; but after all, she and the children too will only be the happier. It will give them all an opportunity to come out from the seclusion in which they have so long lived, and help them to associations that will be better for them in every respect. I am certain that there are thousands-of families in the world, even in this intelligent part and age of it, to whom life has but little aim; who would   330    HOW BENNIE DID IT. experience' a happiness to which they have always been- strangers, could they be induced to connect themselves or their children with the Sabbath School." "True enough, Mary. Even were there no interests of the soul taken into consideration, but only those which look to a social advantage, the benefit to individuals, and families, and com- munities from the Sabbath School work must be incalculable." "But I fear this benefit is too slightly appre- ciated even by many who are professing Chris- tians, judging from the number of such parents, of whom we know, who do not require and see that their children punctually attend." "Well, in this respect you and I have much to be thankful for, in that we have been blessed with parents of different kind. The matter was never allowed to be one of mere choice with me, because of my parents being indifferent; nor was it by their arbitrary requirement that I was a Sabbath School scholar, and a punctual one too. But by a wholesome and unremitted   iTOW BENNIE DID IT.    331 governing on their part, I was taught to con- sider that the Sabbath School and the sanc- tuary, with an intelligent and consistent pre- paration for their services, were as surely a part of my life-work as were eating and sleep- ing. And I bless God that He gave me such parents, for it is to the discipline which they ever thus exercised that I can turn, as to the foundation on which have been 'built the stanchest hopes I have both for earth and heaven." "Indeed may we both be thankful in this respect. And while on this subject, is it; not a singular blindness that seems to rest on parents who permit their children to grow up unmind- ful of the aids to character and usefulness which the Sabbath School imparts?  How many thousands upon thousands of children will doubtless reach heaven, so far as human ap- pliances are an instrumentality at all, through this special agency. And indeed in addition to beingf thankful that we have been scholars   332    IIOW BEiYNIE DID IT. therein, we may also rejoice that we now are teachers. To do good makes life a blessing, and it cannot be possible that he who works prayerfully and faithfully in the Sabbath School should fail of sueh a blessing." And with such intercourse as this the young friends entertained themselves so pleasantly as to be almost surprised to find themselves so quickly at Miss Norton's door, where, with a reluctant "good night," they parted. It is but proper to suppose that Mr. and 1Mrs. Norton would have been growing anxious concerning the late return of their daughter, had they not been aware of the errand on which she was gone. To them it was a pleasure to know that she was thus occupied; in fact, they had ever been careful to develop in her a char- acter for benevolent doing, themselves ac- companying her, when she was a child, on such missions of charity as would aid in such a training. For they believed that in so doing they would not only make her an instrument ot   BOW BENNIE DID IT.     33-3 blessing to others, but would be uprooting any hidden tendencies to selfishness. and so make her a blessing to herself. They were therefore doubly delighted at her return, for they could welcome her as one fresh from a ministration of love, her very counte- nance aglow from the happiness of heart that her visit had occasioned. , Welcome, welcome, my daughter," said her father, folding her in his arms, and then yield- ing her to the dear mother who was waiting her moment to bestow a like loving reception. "We have- been growing impatient," con- tinued he, while Mrs. Norton was assisting her daughter in taking off her hat and Wrappings, ( to learn all about your afternoon's work." "And I am just as impatient, papa dear, to tell you all about it. For indeed the visit has been a surprise and a pleasure to me such as I never experienced on any errand of charity before." "Possibly because Bennie was there," sug- gested her father, with a smile.   334    BRIOW BENNIE DID IT. She replied with a blush, and playfully placed her hand upon his lips. "The first thing that impressed me, when I sat down with the LISLES," said she, "was the refined deportment of the mother, heir every action, as well as her entire conversation re- vealing the fact most plainly that she is in circumstances to which she has not been accus- tomed. And as I turned to her children, they only established the truth, just as royalty and genuine gentility ever assert themselves, by a bearing that none can mistake." "Your report is much; like that of Mr. Wil- son's,- thus far," said Mr. Norton. "He, as you know, interested me iat he family greatly; and if you will be m yescort, I think I must enjoy the pleasure of faking their acquaintance at an early day."  q "iTruly may you say 'enjoy the pleasure,' papa; for I know th  in any visits you may make, or friendship bestow upon them, you will surely feel that their acuaintance is thereby cheaply bought."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.'    335 "There is one thing, apart from any personal interest they may inspire, which will ever cause me to feel especially thankful that they have come to the city of Q--." "Ah! what is it?" "'I am. pretty well convinced that they are greatly instrumental in bringing about the present happy revolution in the flour market, the tidings of which have doubtless gladdened more hearts in our city than has any other one thing in the past ten years 1" "They, papal The Lisles! You surprise me I What on earth could they have done to. wards the matter 7 " Mr. Norton was ,not a little amused at his daughter's startled reception of his announce- ment. "Well, my daughter," replied he, " you know of course how the late unusual excitement and advance in flour was brought about, and also that our friend Mr. Wilson was a protinent party in the affair?"   336     HOW BENNIE DID IT. "Yes, sir." a Well, something or somebody, Bennie Stout probably, was instrumental in stirring his con- science as to the wrong of the procedure; and at a most opportune moment he visited Mrs. Lisle, whose necessities enabled her, without having any knowledge of Mr. Wilson's business, to give him a practical comment on the beau- ties (or deformities, as you please) of the very 'combination; of which he was a part. The poor widow's arguments were so conclusive to his mind that he did not let twenty-four hours pass before he put a lever under the Icombi- nation' that upheaved its very foundations; for he not only put flour on a proper platform and himself with it, but induced his confederates to do the same. Just such a trarnaction I never heard of before, and- it has made more talk, and caused more men to open their eyes as to the right and wrong of things than would all tile D D.'s in the city, if they had besieged it with their heaviest guns for a year to come."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    337 "No wonder that you are thankful that they came here. And I should think that Mr. Wil-. son would' be just as thankful." "He certainly is. I may do him wrong, however, in judging that it was just as much Mrs. Lisle, as Mrs. Lisle's circumstances that so promptly decided the case for him." "Hush, papa," said Mary, laying her hand gently on his lips, " do n't say that. Give him all the credit which the most charitable con. struction will afford." "Thank you, my daughter; I accept the re. proof, and will endeavor to act in accordance with it. At the same time, I want you to un.  derstand clearly what I meant in speaking as I did. My opinion is only this, that Mr. Wilson is sometimes slow in reaching the inner princi- ple of actions, and has consequently to be brought slowly thereto by personal considera- tions. Had Mrs. Lisle been other than she is, I am inclined to think that the work would not have been done as promptly and effectually as it was." 22   338    HOWIV BE YtIE DID IT. "But you believe that Mr. Wilson now has a clear understanding of all the principle in the case, do n't you?" "Yes; but I also believe that Mrs. Lisle had much to do in helping him up to that point; hence my thankfulness that she is here. And now let me ask if you learned anything special of the history of the family?" "Indeed, I learned nothing more, papa, than the general idea, which, as I have told you, is patent enough to anybody who has intercourse with them that they are both by birth and as- sociation far above the circumstances in which they now are." "And that is about all the inforimation, so far as I am informed, that anybody has as yet been able to obtain. How is it that no one has learned more?" "That I can't say; but there was a con- sciousness of restraint continually with me as to any close inquiry into their circumstances; or if I made any attempt that way, my efforts were surely, though continually foiled, as if the   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     339 subject contained secrets that were not to be known." "I think I must see them soon," said Mr. Norton. And I think I must, too," said his wife. "And so must I," said his daughter. "Very well; we'll all see them  together," said the father. Whereupon the tea-bell rang, and arrested the talk about THE LISLES.   CHAPTER X I L BENNTE was usually at his desk, mornings, a n hour before the coming of Mr. Wilson: and as he was now of course occupying a con- fidential position in the house, many of the let- ters of the early mail were opened, assorted, and some at once answered by him.   One morning, while occupied with the mail, as we have stated, a young salesroom clerk of the house, whom- Bennie knew 'to be faithful and efficient in the duties of his position, entered the office and requested a few moments' con. versation. "I am in a straitened condition, Mr. Stout," said he, " and have come with the hope that I can interest you in my behalf." 'Your hope shall certainly not be disap- pointed, Charley," was the kind reply; "for   I0 Wt BEN2VIE DID IT.   341 it will afford me a pleasure to serve you if my service will be of any value. What's the matter?" "Thank you. I was confident you would willingly do for me what you could, -and I am not less confident that your influence exerted in my behalf will be of great service. The matter is simply this. My mother and young sister are dependent on me for support, and although we have for some time been practising rigid economy and living on the humblest fare, I am going behind. Something I must do that will make me a better income, but what it will be I cannot think." "Have you anything to propose?" "I have come with the hope that you might propose something." "Your salary, I believe, is as large as that of any salesman on your floor, is it not?" "Yes, the largest." And has from time to time been increased?" Yes."    342    HOW BE NN1E DID IT. "Does Mr. Wilson know your circuimstan- ces?"  "He knows that my mother and sister are dependent on me, but he doubtless has no other thought than that we are getting along comfort- ably enough." "Why do n't you state your case frankly to him?" "I hardly know how to approach him on such a matter. 'Business is business' with him, as you are aware, and I cannot hope that anything I could say would induce him to look at my case in any other light than that, as I am receiving as good a salary as any young man on my floor, I am doing very well and all I ought to expect." "And to a certain extent he would be right," said Bennie; " but at the same time, there are doubtless openings which he might easily make in vour favor whereby you could comfortably provide for the family dependent on you." "So I believe: nevertheless I fear I am not   HOW BE2NNI  DID IT.   843 the one to open his eyes to such a considera- tion, and- "You would like me to open them for you," interposed Bennie with a smile, as he noticed the young man's hesitation. "You've guessed it exactly: and if you will undertake the case, I shall at once be confident that there will come a favorable result, for which you will have my lasting gratitude." "But what would you have me d )?" "I don't know. I only know my necessity." And you have lthing to suggest? '.' "Nothing." "So I must plan the house, and build it too." "And will prove yourself fully competent both as architect and builder, I am certain," added the young man with an assured tone. , ' Very well," said Benuie cheerfully; i let me think it over a day or two, and we 't1 see what can be done." "Thank you, thank you, friend Stout," replied the young man, leaving the office, "I don't   HtIOW BENNIE DID IT. know what you will do, but I shall work very cJ  fully to-day, for I shall enjoy a confident n of relief." oInQ after he had left the office, Mr. Wilson came in.    But Bennie was much engrossed with thoughts of the young man during the morning, turning over and over in his mind various plans not only for approach- ing Mr. Wilson with the case, but for suggest- ing something that might be done. " Has not something disturbed you to-day, Benjamin?" asked Mr. Wilson an hour or so before leaving his office. "Yes, sir;I have a case in hand that I do n't know exactly how to work through." " Can I assist you ?" " I think you could do so, sir, decidedly, if I had the matter in a proper shape to present." "Is there any necessity for long deliberation ? Probably I might be able to assist you not only in shaping the case, but in working it fully through."   'Thank you, sir; I will state it at once. Our' young and excellent salesman, Charley Haywood, is in trouble." Mr. Wilson started with an apprehension of some terrible evil. "You look   alarmed," continued  Bennie, "but you may quiet your apprehensions. His trouble arises simply from the fact that with his present position and salary he is unable to provide comfortably for the mother and young sister who look to him for support." " Well," replied Mr. Wilson,"' that is to him and them a serious trouble. He has always appeared to me a faithful and deserving young man, and it is doubtless my duty to devise some means for his relief. So far, however, as an advanced position in the house is concerned, there is no situation that I know of to which he could be transferred. And then again, I do n't want to lose him even were he offered a better position in another house." " I would be sorry myself to part with him,"   346    HOW BENNIE DID IT. replied Bennie, " and so I believe would every- body in the house; and in fact his services are so valuable that it would be unwise either to' transfer him from his position as a salesman or to let him leave us." "But unless we change his work, how are we to help his case? There are half a dozen others in the house as meritorious as he, whose cases would certainly demand prompt attention were we to take any special step in his favor." "But there are not half a dozen others as needy," suggested Bennie. "True enough.  Can you propose any- thing?" "Nothing, sir; this was the point I had not yet worked through." "Well, if you can't, I can. You and I will pray over it to-night.", "Sir!" exclaimed Bennie with a burst of surprise he could not control. "We will pray over it to-night," repeated Mr. Wilson, calmly.   How BENzIE DID IT.     347 Bennie's heart swelled full; and in the ex- uberance of his joy he extended his hand to his employer without saying a word. "Can we do anything better, my boy?" asked Mr. Wilson. "No indeed, sir, nothing; it's the very best thing we can do in all of our circumstances, whether of prosperity or perplexity; but Mr. Wilson, do you,pray?" "1! certainly I do. I hope I am not ex- cluded from the privilege." "Oh, no, no sir, far from it, and I dam de- lighted beyond expression to learn that you are now looking to God for His direction in all your affairs. But may I ask when you began to pray?" "Recently," replied the merchant, cordially pressing the hand of his clerk, which he still held "and influenced to do so, so far as the human agency is concerned, by the consistent Christian deportment and counsel of Benjamin Stout." A .   348    110 V BENNIE DID IT. Once more Bennie's heart -was full, and tears of grateful joy filled his eyes. "I bless God, Mr. Wilson, for this day's pleasure," said he; "many have been the prayers wlhicll I have offered in your behalf since we have been together, and I have had an abiding faith that in due time my prayers would have a gracious answer. You have a generous heart, which has only needed the lead- ing of an enligltened and sanctified judlgment to make you a blessing in all the walks of life; and I know in seeking counsel continually of God, through our divine Saviour, Jesus, you will be an effective illustration of the power of Christian principle. This is to me indeed a most happy mlomcnt, for it is like the opening of a future in which all my relations to you, and yours to everybody Helse, will be new, sanc- tified, and blessed. And as toour young friend Haywood, most gladly will I join you to-night at the mercy-seat in seeking direction in his behalf."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     349 And, faithful to their -engagement, the mer- chant and clerk, each in his respective chamber, bowed together before God that night, and sup- plicated providential guidance on the case in hand. And before Mr. Wilson's eyes were closed in sleep, both light and decision came so clearly to his mind thatliwithout one wavering thought he laid his plans for the morrow, and rested tranquilly in the prospect; after which he enjoyed a most delightful night's repose. At the first glance of his employer in the morning, Bennie was well enough satisfied that a satisfactory decision had been reached. "I am confident that the matter is happily settled," said he, as he stood by Mr. Wilson's desk with a handful of opened letters. "Yes, and so clearly as well as strangely, that I can only accept my decision as an un- mistakable answer to our prayers.  Hay- wood's salary will be infcreased." "And what of his position?"   inquired Bennie.   350    HOW BENrNIE DID IT. "It will remain what it is. Has not a similar plan occurred to you?" "Yes, sir." "Did you think of it yesterday?" "Yes, sir: but the probable obstacle of dis- satisfaction on the part of the other clerks kept me from even hinting at it." '"I have not the slightest apprehension on that point," said Mr. Wilson. -"I am indeed very happy to hear you say so," said Bennie, "and if all will look at the case in a proper light, we need have no fear." "God controls elements and minds and hearts, my boy; and as we have faithfully prayed, so may we faithfully hope." Singular change I the man who had hitherto walked in darkness now walked in light, and instead of receiving was now giving the coun- sel that came from a heart renewed and rich in faith! An hour before Mr. Wilson left the house that day,he caused all the clerks of similar   IO W BENNIE DID IT.    351 position and salary with young( Haywood to be summoned to his office; and it may be well imagined that this very unusual summons from their employer occasioned considerable surprise and even some consternation among the clerks. When all were assembled, there being some twenty oir more, Mr. Wilson addressed them e thus: "My purpose in inviting you thus to my -office, young gentlemen, is that in a step which I propose taking with reference to one of your number,.you may understand, as I hope you will appreciate, the motives by which I am influenced; and as it might be that some of you might accuse me of injustice, or of making an unwar- rantable discrimination, I will request that any one who may think he is wronged by my action will freely say so before leaving the office. By so doing, all misconception will be rectified, and we will go again to our several duties without harboring any unkind feelings. "It is known to you that one of your number, Mr. Haywood, has dependent upon him his N   352    IO W BENNIE DID IT. mother and sister. For this you of course are not answerable; nor, as such matters are usually looked at, is it any reason why, in the question of salary, a discrimination should be made in his favor. True he has served mne faithfully; but I am happy that I can say the same of you all; and if it were a mere question of merit, it would be as proper that I should begin with any one of your number in advanc- ing salaries as with him. In fact, if you were not all receiving the largest salaries now paid in the city for corresponding services, it would be my duty to at once have-you all advanced alike. But here is a young man who is commendably using all the income of his best days in, supporting those who have him alone to whom to look. I propose to double his salary, so that he may be on a level, and have the same advantage in the world with yourselves. In some respects this may be con- sidered an unsafe precedent, as in other houses there are doubtless young men similarly situated whose employers will not feel any obligation to   BOW .BENNIE DID IT.    853 act in the same way. But it is that kind of case in which each is to judge for himself. I, however, have been greatly prospered and. blessed, and therefore recognize an obligation on myself to use my prosperity in encourag- ing and helping others. You will understand that I do not consider this a case of charity; nor has Mr. Haywood requested me to do what I propose. God has placed him and me in our respective circamstances, and I accept the instructions tot me, wherein we are taught to 'bear one another's burdens,' as indicative that I help him bear his burden just as I propose." As the merchant concluded, he was greeted with -a burst' of applause, joined in by every clerk in the room, such as left him no cause to doubt that he was warmly indorsed, at least, by all within the sound of his voice. When this had subsided, young Haywood, in tones tremulous with gratitude, expressed his thanks most courteously to his employer, and then to his associates, for the genseous manner in which they responded to the proposition which, 23  !   354    HOW BENNIE DID IT. although an immense benefit to a home in need, was in one sense making a very unusual excep- tion against themselves. After which all dis- persed to their several duties, evidently happier for- the incidents of the hour. "Oh, that I had learned to pray sooner," said Mr. Wilson to Bennie when they were left alone, " for surely my life would not only have been more delightful to myself, but would have been a blessing to others." "It may be, Mr. Wilson, that you have many years yet to iive,"'suggested Bennie. "By which you would intimate that I may yet have abundant opportunities for doing good." "Even so." "God grant that I may; and that with every opportunity I may have not only the ability but the heart." "A worthy ambition and prayer too, Mr. Wilson. Situated as you are, as to this world's goods, if you do but sanctify yourself, your time, talents and means, for the glory of God   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     355 and the well-being of your fellow-men, yours may surely be an enviable life." "Such as yours always has been," said the merchant. "I would not say that it has not," replied Bennie, without affectation; "but this I feel most certainly, that to any degree in which my life may have been a blessing, divine grace has implanted both principle and power; so that although I may have enjoyed the privilege of being thus used, I would ascribe the praise and i glory to Him to whom it is due." It may well be supposed that Bennie went to his home that evening with a very happy heart. And indeed he had been made the instrument for the accomplishment of no small work. For his employer, hardened, as we  stated many pages back, by long and unimproved gospel privileges, was one of the kind of men who are not easily wrought upon and changed to the Christian standard.  Wherefore Bennie might well be thankful and happy that through him, in   356    HOW BENNIE' DID IT. great degree, Mr. Wilson had become what he was. But there was some one else to whom Bennie knew that the information he had to-day gained would be most gratifying, and that one was Mr. Norton. So he determined to turn his steps towards the house of that gentleman and make known the good news. "I wish to see Mr. Norton, a few moments," said he to the servant at the door. And he and the. lawyer were soon together in the library. "I have called upon you at a somewhat un- seasonable hour, Mr. Norton," said he, "but this has been to me a most interesting day, for I have learned something which I knew would be such gratifying news to you that I could not resist the desire to call and acquaint you with it." Whereupon he gave Mr. Norton an account of the incidents of the day, his whole counte nance aglow with the narragon, but specially s   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     357 as he approached the point where he could say that Mr. Wilson was a praying man! "Is it so at last?" exclaimed Mr. Norton with a burst of joy, " then have -I the long looked for answer to my prayers. Years have I waited, with the patience of hope. Do you know, Ben- jamin, that when I sought a place for you with Mr. Wilson I did so with the confident expec- tation that you would be enabled so to illus- trate to him the reality and power of Chris. tian character as to uproot his prejudices, and eventually induce him to accept the great salva- tion? Prior to your engagement with him, his confidence in boys was small. Having no chil- dren, it seemed as though his heart was sealed to all sympathy for the young; and as for Sab- bath School work, he never would have spoken of it, except with a sneer, had it not been that myself and one or two others of his intimate friends were so connected with it that he felt that any such deportment would have been an injury to our feelings. Well do I remember the almost scornful expression that curled his   858    HOW BENNIE DID IT. lip when ad I was presenting your case to him he said,- ' He is one of your Sunday School boys, I suppose?' "But that is all past; and it will be with a most gratified feeling, when we meet again, that I shall salute him as a brother in Christ, and bid him welcome to companionship with us in all the glorious associations of Christian character and labor. And I may well congratulate you, in that you have been to so great a degree the instrument in his conversion. But I must also caution you, although I do not know that it is necessary, that you permit no spiritual vanity to usurp the place of gratitude. There is cer- tainly no higher exaltation to which we may. attain in this life than that of being made co- workers with our blessed Master in the upbuild. ing of His kingdom; and when we love the work so that we steadfastly engage in it with a consecration and devotion that puts away self, we may bless God that He thus honors and accepts us for His service."   riHOW BENNIE DID ITr    359 "I do not know," replied Bennie, "that self has entered into my thoughts, in any improper respect, in connection with any efforts I have made to influence Mr. Wilson to turn to the ways of righteousness. In fact, I can't remem- ber that I have had any thought about it except the natural curlent of feeling which centred on him, and the use of every consistent effort to do him good. Nor have I been conscious, or at most to a very small degree, that I was to be the instrument of his conversion. I would not, if I know my own heart, deceive myself or others with an affectation of humility im this respect; and in, fact, if we, for any purpose, were making investigation as to the instrumen- talities entire that have wrought the change in Mr. Wilson, I can easily and knowingly turn to others, yourself prominently included, as certainly connected with it. But all this is un- necessary, any farther than as we may use such investigation as enabling us to try our motives and see whether the glory of God, or our own spiritual vanity, be that which influences us in -  '     fi    360    .HOW BEIVNNIE DID IT. all we do. We can thank God that our friend stands ready to enroll himself as a follower of Christ, and to use his powerful facilities for the glory and honor of our Master, and the inter- ests of His kingdom." "True enough, my young friend," said Mr. Norton, "this thought may well delight us. The salvation of Mr. Wilson's soul is to him a blessing past computation; and it is just as im- possible to estimate the influence which lie can exert for good by a life thoroughly consecrated to Christ. The more I think of the influence and the responsibilities of such a man, the more does my joy seem to increase that our friend's talents are to be thus enlisted; and it seems as though even to-morrow would be too long to wait before seeing and congratulating him on the stand he has taken." *   *   *   *    * The reader will not be surprised to learn that Mr. Norton was an early visitor the next morning at the office of Mr. Wilson. And very different were the feelings with which the friends   DUHOW BENNIE DID IT.   -361 met from those they had ever before experi. enced. "I could not long stay away from you, after the good news which I last evening heard through our young friend Bennie," said Mr. Norton; "words cannot express the pleasure with which I welcome you to the fellowship of Christian communion." "I have much indeed to thank you for, friend Norton," replied Mr. Wilson; "for in all your kind efforts in my behaff you must have had much to try your patience and weaken your faith. In lobking back over my principles and positions, I am amazed at the darkness which has hitherto shrouded all; and I seem to my- self like one either waked from a sleep, or roused from a lethargy so deep as to need the aid of a superhuman elergy." "Which is simply true," remarked Mr. Nor- ton, "in the case of the natural heart always. It is God's Holy Spirit, as He Himself tells us, that awakens and convicts the sinner, and makes him see his benighted condition. Dead, e   8 '    362    HOW BEN N-IE DID IT. as we are, in trespasses and sins, no human agency can arouse and make us live; for as the stream ises no higher than the fountain, so will the perceptions and purposes and life of the unrenewed man reach nothing higher than the level of his natural heart. How absurd the idea which some seem to entertain, hat they caA make themselves, even in spiritual life, just/ what they please." "True enough; but it is a sad thought that ther a  those who use this very fact with which to relieve themselves from responsibility." "A11 of which is only the more corroborative of the fact of the heart's depravity. The free and general invitations of the gospel leave none without excuse; the trouble is, that the terms of the gospel, not being agreeable to the natural heart of so many, they refuse compliance, and therefore must expect hereafter to feel'their condemnation just. You, for instance, I will affirm, do not now attempt to justify yourself for the impenitency in which you have so long lived."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     363 "Ah, no indeed, far from it. There are only with me feelings of wonder and gratitude that I have been spared during these long years, and that kind friends have continually been employed to labor for my escape from the dark- ness into the light. And what a delightful experience it is, to have the soul brought into harmony with God and His law, and to have all our tastes and desires and lives identified with the interests of His glorious kingdom. What a satisfying thought that all our efforts in this connection maike for the glory of Christ, and the welfare and happiness of our fellow men. But to me it is a singular moral phenomenon that I cra experience this feeling now as r never had any tendency to before; and also that Ican form to myself no conception as to- how the change has been produced. Within a few days past I have deliberately tasked my mind to a comparison of its present workings with those of the days gone by, to see if I could trace any comparison; but there appears no   364     HOW BENNIE DID IT. more similarity than if I were entirely a new or another man." "Which in reality is the fact," remarked Mr. Norton, " for the converted man is a new man, and nothing less. The talk of our Saviour -with Nicodemus meant all that was expressed. The reception of Christ into the heart is being 'born again'; that is, it is the radical change which so completely transforms the man in his views, principles, tastes, aims, and efforts, that he is essentially born again. And even the. wrong that he may possibly do, as the result of confirtned habit, or as yet unenlightened, or unsanctified capacity, establishes nothing in opposition to the claim of a new birth; for in his newhorn desires there is the ineradicable germ of holy principle, which will make him 'grow in grace,' even as the living child grows in strength and stature from infancy to man- hood. The very injunction itself, 'grow inr grace' is the assertion that we are not yet com- plete; that we have no more fully attained -   BOW BENATIE DID IT.     365 thereto than has the newhorn babe at once become a man."           I "All that I can say is, praise and glory to Him who by His Holy Spirit has renewed me thus. My whole life seems so imbued with the heavenly principle, that peace and joy surround me on every side; and there is an unspeakable pleasure in looking into life's future, because of the continued opportunities which I hope will be afforded me for living to the glory of Him who gave Himself for me." And thus remaining together as long as their business engagements would permit did the two friends enjoy themselves with Christian com- munion. To them both the hour was one laden with strange sensations, such as they had niever known   before. Long, long years had they been friends, notwithstanding their unconge- niality on the all important subject. Many, many, had been their conversations on this very topic, but through it all the merchant had been unimpressible;- nay more, for the times had not been few when he but scarcely sup. v "U :W X    366    IROW BENNIE DID IT. pressed tie scoff or the sneer, which nothing but his high and unabated esteem for Mr. Nor- ton enabled him to control, and of this the latter was conscious; but with a judicious and an unwavering energy he prayed and labored, until at last he enjoyed the fruit of all his work.   CHAPTER   XIV. v TET us pass over a few weeks in our history, and look in upon the LISLES. Their circum- stances are now decidedly improved, and the mother's once sad .face has assumed an air of cheerfulness refreshing to see. The night on which the shivering little Nenie first met Ben- nie Stout was in ceed a turning point in the family's history; for from that moment not only had their daily wants been supplied, but they had enjoyed the steady visitations of kind and intelligent friends who really felt that every visit brought a full return of pleasure. Bennie had been accompanied by his mother and sis- ters; and although there had been no, formal exchanging of visits, the widow and her chil: dren were now and then enjoying a pleasant evening at the home of the STOUTS. Miss Nor.   368    HOW BEIVNNIE DID IT. ton, too, had been a faithful friend, having her mother for a companion visitor on one or two occasions. It is unnecessary to say in detail how sincere a friend the family had found in this lovely Christian girl. From the momennt that she received the promise from-Mrs. Lisle that the children- might attend the Sabbath School, she had, with the most delicate consid- eration, made arrangements for clothing and all else that was necessary for them to be as pre- sentable as the another could reasonably wish. And when the Sabbath morning came, they were by herself presented to the Superintendent with such a word of explanation as would secure for them every consistent attention. True, too, to the promise she gave the little Willie on the first night they met, she took him into her own class where, in close nestling by her side he was relieved from every embarrass- ment and fear. So that when the pleasant little trio returned to their home their hearts were unspeakably happy, both from the enjoy- ment of the exercises of the school, and from   ROW BENNIE DID IT.     369 tie kind attentions and, teachings they had received. Contrary, however, to his first intentions, Mr. Norton has as yet not made the acquaintance of the widow, except by mere, formal introduc- tion through his daughter in the vestibule of the church, where on three or four successive Sab. baths mere passing courtesies were exchanged. But there were two good reasons for the uninten- tional delay: first, because he knew that so far as the necessities of the family were concerned, abundant and careful attention was provided; and next, there had been upon him for a few weeks past such a press of obligations that he -had actually not been able to command time for aaght else, except the things that must have attention. But from the latter hinderance he was now relieved, and accordingly made an early opportunity for obtaining a home acquaint. ance with the family; and as he desired to see the children, and enjoy a visit with them equally with their mother, he proposed to devote an afternoon for the purpose.

"Unless you have an engagement for this afternoon," said he at the breakfast-table to his wife and daughter, "I would be happy to have ah hour or so with the LISLES; and in fact I much regret that I have not been able to do so at an earlier day." And as both the ladies were under no engagement, the invitation was cheerfully ac- cepted. Mrs. Lisle received them with unaffected pleasure, and withal, with so much grace and dignity that Mr. Norton was at once delighted with her. "My daughter has of course acquainted you with the reasons why I have not enjoyed this pleasure at an earlier day," said he; "but as I have .lad confidence in her as an acceptable representative, I have been reconciled to the delay as I would not otherwise." "You have indeed but done' her justice, Mr. Norton," replied Mrs. Lisle;" and you may also be thankful that you have such a representative. It is hardly necessary for me to attempt to   speak of what her visits have been to us. The provision for our outer comforts which she, with other kind friends, have made, has from us, I assure you, more than a mere passing gratitude; but at the same time it bears no comparison with the solace and cheer that has been brought to our hearts, for this has raised us to energy and hope. Instead of looking to the past with despondency, I look to the future with delightful anticipation. And herein I think lies the secret, as well as the efficiency, of the Christian's genuine mission, in that he works with reference to social and spiritual relief, without thinking that duty has been, done in providing merely for the needs of the body." "Your idea reaches the case precisely," said Mr. Norton, "and experience enables you most happily to present it. But after all, the heart, I think, can only have such perceptions as to the true aim of life and its duties when it has been sanctified by the grace that is from above. How many thousands of people there are in the world who give and do, when cases of   372     HOW BENNIE/ DID IT. necessity are presented to them, and yet who enjoy little from the act because the proper motive is wanting. There is a great distinc- tion between a natural benevolence and a spiritual or sanctified benevolence." "Indeed, sir, you are correct. But to make such an assertion in the presence of vast num- bers of people, you might prepare yourself for opposition and conflict. There is an idea, as you know, that a deed is a deed, and that all the moral purpose and responsibility are cen- tred and terminated therein. But it is a won- derful awakening, that regeneration causes in such logic, as every regenerated heart will- testify." "I am happy to say," remarked Mr. Norton, "t that we have a recent and substantial illustra- tion of this question ia the case of our friend Mr. Wilson. His views now are totally diffe:- ent from those which I have over and over heard him express for these twenty years. Like Saul at Damascus, there have fallen 'scales' from his eyes, and he is so bewildered   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     373 with the change that he is battling the air with efforts to solve the philosophy of it." "In a case like his, such feelings are natural," said Mrs. Lisle; "but happily the change is so thorough that he will soon cease these efforts, and enjoy even what he cannot understand. This is faith's work, the power and continuance of which he will neither desire nor be able to resist, and more and more his heart will be moved and thrilled with the joy of his Master's, work. Oh," continued she, her countenance more and more glowing with enthusiasm in the thought, "what a life of pleasure, and how unremitted, is - there before Mr. Wilson and all who, as he, commit themselves to the hearty service of Him who went about doing good!" ' Have you been long a Christian, Mrs. Lisle?" inquired Mrs. Norton. "I made a profession of religion some ten years ago, or about the time of the- birth of our dear Nenie," was the reply. "We were then in Europe, where my husband had taken   H:OW BENNIE DID IT. me with a view to relief from the depression occasioned by my mother's death." "And when you made the profession of religion," continued Mrs, Norton, "did you experience, in kind, the change and support such as has been found by Mr. Wilson?" "Ah yes; that was whence came the first favorable symptoms in my case, for confidence in 4 Him who doeth all things well' supplanted murmuring and repining. There was the new life; and while, like Mr. Wilson, I was amazed at the change and could not understand it, my peace and joy were too great to forego because I could not fully explain the cause. The relief came, and T accepted it with a thankful heart, and gave myself to the duties of life, strength- ened with the faith that what I,knew not now I would know hereafter." "Was your husband a professor of religion at that time?" "No, Mrs. Norton, he was not. But he was a man of such intelligent observation, that   10 W BENNIE DID IT.   delighted as well as surprised at the change which had been accomplished in me, he not only saw, but felt, the power of the religion I had embraced, and embraced it too. Gratitude and pleasure may of course have influenced him much in his first considerations; but as light broke in, he saw the necessary connection between gratitude and the expression of it; hence, most naturally, he began to pray, and although in his case the succession was slow, the result was sure, and he became a Christian of enlarged faith and zeal." "Your mother, I trust, was a Christianr?" "Al I yes, and such an one as I, probably, would speak of extravagantly. But there can be no impropriety in my quoting her as one in whose daily deportment there was the happiest illustration of the workings of divine grace. When my own heart was similarly touched, I ceased to mourn her departure from earth, and experienced a new pleasure in contemplating her enlarged attainments and happiness in heaven."   HOW BENNIE DID IT. "A delightful contemplation, truly," remarked Mr. Norton, ".and one which is increased in proportion as we seek to have ourselves adapted to the same blessedness. May I ask, Mrs. Lisle, where your mother died?" "In the city of New York." "Did I understand you that her death oc- curred about ten years ago?" "Rather more than that. I said it was about ten years ago that I made a profession of religion." "May I ask what was your mother's name?" "ELLSWORTH," replied the widow, with some hesitation, caused she hardly knew why. "Again let me ask," said Mr. Norton, earn- estly, " what was her maiden name?" "PRESTON," was the more prompt reply, although as she uttered it the widow was con- scious of a sensation that almost choked the attempt to speak. "And was her given name ADELAIDE?" "Yes sir." "Can it be possible?" exclaimed Mr. Norton,   ri '    HOW BENNIE DID IT.   3"   as with the deepest agitation he rose and paced the floor. "Why papa!" cried both'his wife   and daughter, springing towards him in alarm "What can be the matter?" "The matter, my darling daughter!" quickly replied he, clasping the black-eyed little Willie in his arms, "the matter is, that this little fellow is your cousin!" The condition into which this announcement threw the little company may be imagined. Astonished and even bewildered beyond de- scription, they stood for a moment or two gazing at each other and then at Mr. Norton, as though they feared he did not know of what he was talking. And then as reason and thought re- sumed place, and they were able to believe and comprehend the position, there came a scene of rejoicing and recognition that knew no bounds. To Mrs. Lisle, however, the whole thing was overwhelming. In circumstances such as hers to have found any who were thus related to her, the discovery would have been a joyful   HOW BENNIE DID IT.. one, unless it had been that those thus found were of such character that their name was a reproach; but to learn that the Nortons were her own kindred was to her a joy almost too good to be true. And this joy, too, was height- ened by the fact that the discovery was evidently no less agreeable to them than to her. But the most delightful feature in the whole affair was the unbounded happiness which the children exhibited at the information, experi- enced of course because of their great love for Miss Norton. "You, OUR COUSIN!" cried the overjoyed Nenie, clasping her arms about the neck of the lovely girl, and impressing kiss after kiss upon her cheeks and lips," You, our cousin! oh, it's delightful." "Yes, indeed," added the affectionate little Nettie. Our darling cousin Mary: oh, oh, oh, so nice." "My cousin too," cried Willie, looking for a place where to twine his arms, as well as an /  'E e",  +   I   opportunity to do a little kissing on his own account. "Yes, your cousin too, you precious little lamb," exclaimed Miss Norton, clasping him lovingly to her heart, "and happy enough to be so. Indeed, I am so full of joy that my heart seems too small to contain it all." But we cannot possibly/escribe the rejoic- ings and the expressions of the occasion, and will therefore pass on to an explanation of all that has thus come about, allowing the parties concerned, by their own conversation, to make explanations for us. *    *    *    * "Now papa,"l said Mary Norton, when the demonstrations of surprise were sufficiently subsided, "we of course want to understand; about all this. Up to this moment we have all yielded ourselves so entirely to enthusiastic joy that we have not entertained a thought as to how ridiculous we would appear if your an-. nouncement should prove premature. You said, for instance, that master Willie here and   380    HOW BE NNIE DID IT. I are cousins; but I don't see how it can be 80." "You and he are second cousins, my daugh- ter," replied Mr. Norton, "but you may rest assured that you have this unmistakable rela- tion, and which is none too distant to prevent you from loving each other in the common bond of consanguinity, than if you were brother and sister. Mrs. Lisle and I are own cousins, beyond all doubt." "Well, let 's trace it up," said Mrs. Norton. "Very well, here is the record, short and plain. Mrs. Lisle's mother and mine were sisters; and although it has, been many years since my mother died, as you know, - you,emy daughter, never having seen her,--I can remem- ber often hearing her speak of a younger sister who married an ELLSWORTH Iand removed South. And as is too often the case, being far separated, and travelling facilities not being abundant, they not only saw each other seldom, but their correspondence grew gradually less until they became as strangers; and I cannot   R BOW BENNIE DID IT.    381 now remember that I have even once heard, except indirectly, of my Aunt Adelaide since my mother's death. It is one of the strange things that occur in the history of families that their separated members do often become thus ignorant of each other's circumstances, but it is nevertheless true, account for it as we may, or inexcusable as it may be. ', And now, my dear cousin," continued Mr. Norton, turning cheerfully to Mrs. Lisle, " we want to ,know at once all :about the intervening history of your mother and self, if agreeable to you to furnish it. This is certainly an event- ful afternoon with, us all, but it will only be a more agreeable one by a mutual knowledge of the providences by which we have been sepa- rately led, and are now so singularly brought together." "The history you shall have at once," was the reply, "' and given, too, with great pleasure by me. But there is one thing of which I would remark beforehand. On the evening of our dear cousin Mary's first visit to us, I was   382    HOW BENNIE DID IT. so impressed with the resemblance between her and my darling Nenie that a strange idea immediately possessed me, which was in fact nothing mlore nor less than something akin to what is developed to-day. My mother told me- years ago of an older sister who married a NORTON; and although never having known nor seen any member of the family, and of course but little expecting ever to meet any of them, yet when one of the name was intro. duced, and that one bearing such a striking resemblance to my child, it was natural enough that singular surmises should be awakened. My thoughts, however, I communicated to no one; and although the developments ,of this hour .have filled me with a delight that is simply indescribable, I am probably the least surprised of us all. And now for the history." "Before you- proceed, Mrs. Lisle," said Mrs. Norton, I let me say that the resemblance be- tween our children has been, I am confident, not more apparent to you than to Mr. Norton and myself; and you may be assured, too, that   HOW BEWNNIE DID IT. -   883 we most fully reciprocate your delight arising from a knowledge of the relationship existing between our families.", "Indeed, I thank you most sincerely for, say- ing so, Mrs. Norton," replied Mrs. Lisle, "especially as it is not generally the case that families in your circumstances are made happy by the knowledge of a relation with onein such as ours." "If there were the slightest apprehension in; your mind on this point, my dear cousin, it may be put at once to rest," said Mr. Norton, with an emphasis that was unmistakable.. "Indeed may it," quickly added Mary, again catching little Willie in her arms and kissing him most affectionately. "And now for the history," said Mr. Norton. "Yes, the history," answered Mrs. Lisle. ;My mother's marriage occurred, as you, Mr. Norton, doubtless know, in the pretty town of DALTON, some two hundred miles, I believe, from the city of Q---. Soon after the marriage, my- father made a business connection with a   384    HOW BENNIE DID IT. cotton house in the citV of CHARLESTON, South Carolina, where he was' favored with such con- tinued prosperity that he rapidly rose from X competence to great wealth; and as my parents had come from associations of the most genteel and refined" character, their introductions to society in Charleston were to kindred circles; so that I of course grew up, so far as position was concerned, under the most advantageous circumstances.., "At the age of twenty I married Mr. Lisle; and as time and opportunity will afford, you will gain such information as will satisfy you that in my husband I possessed the treasure of an honorable and high-toned gentleman, whose character when subsequently sanctified by divine grace made him indeed a pattern of noble manhood. "A few months after my marriage, my father died; and almost immediately following that sad event, propositions of an apparently very i advantageous character being made to my hus- band to open a larige business house in the city --. .   HOW BENNIE .DID IT.    385 of New York, we removed there, accompanied by my mother. We were but fairly located there when my mother, who had appeared crushed by my father's death, also died. Being the only child, and having no home kindred to whom to turn during the hours of my hus- band's absence at business, as well as being a stranger in a great city, my spirits sank to such an alarming degree that my husband, who ever exhibited for me thee most devoted fond- ness, arranged his business matters as speedily as possible, and took me to Europe. There my Nenie was born; and there, too, I found peace and comfort in the acceptance of Christ as my Saviour. To my husband's evident delight, as of course to my own, a  re-action at once came to me both in spirits and health, and in a few months we returned to our home. "Prosperity now lightened my pathway for a few years, exhibiting itself in my husband's business matters, ia the successive births of these dear children, in the continued health of our household, in the friends who  gathered 26   386    HOW BENNIE DID IT. about us, but over and above all, that my husband becoming a Christian we were a family that went together to the house of God, and were living in the animating hope that we would dwell together in the 'house not made with hands,' when the scenes of life were closed.. "But in time came the day of darkness. Commercial disaster spread over the land, and in the general crash my husband's house was compelled to go; and, by a singularly unhappy connection, it seemed as though every one with whom we had been on terms of friendship and to whom, under ordinary circumstances, we might have turned for aid, were made, with us, only objects of sympathy, and compelled to turn whatever way they could to meet the neces- sities of life. "All this, however, was nothing compared with what was in reserve for my little ones and myself; for in a short time a cold which my husband contracted developed a rapid con- sumption, and he was quickly taken from us.   HO W BENNIE DID IT.    387 And here one might have feared for me a renewal of the depression into which I so deeply sank from my rother's death; but it did not come. On the contrary, my faith in X 'Him who doeth all things well' seemed only to brighten, and ;my strength was indeed ' accord- ing to my day.' Gathering the little that was left of our little store, among which are some choice items that you here see, which were generously allowed me by creditors, I deter- mined to seek a living and an education for my children among strangers, and -where I could have7 the least- that would keep alive recollections of what was unpleasant in the past. So we came here some months since, procured these rooms, remained secluded, and have done such sewing as we could. My little means, however, grew steadily less, and want began to look us in the face, its most decided manifestation being at the time when bread became so suddenly high. Then my spirits sunk, my purse became exhausted, and, in my   388    HOW BEVNIE DID IT. extremity, and without hardly knowing what I was doing, I permitted my darling child to go into the street to beg!" Overcome by the recital of this history, the widow ceased and found a relief from the sad feelings that were excited in tears. She, how- ever, regained her composure in a few moments, and proceeded. "With the rest of our history you are acquainted. Looking back to the incidents of that sad evening, we may indeed well say that the circumstances were most providential and singular. How very strange that out of the thousands of gentlemen whom Nenie met in the crowded street -she should make her appeal to the one who possibly was the only one who would have responded in the case just as Mr. Stout did; and that he was the only one, most probably, who could have opened up the way that was to. lead to the developments of this evening! But there are numberless instances in our lives, just such as this, if we would   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     389 properly note them, that would tend to the strengthening of our faith and to teaching us that we do not walk by chance." "You have been led by a devious way, my dear cousin," said Mr. Norton, when Mrs. Lisle had ceased; " and although much of the record is a sad, it is nevertheless an interesting one. But we may hope that you have now come to a point where much of the burden of anxiety can be laid aside, and you,'can find repose. Your- self and children may feel that in myself and family you have those who will be only too happy in this newly found addition to our circle of kindred, and will consider your inter- ests in common with our own, What say you, wife and daughter?" "I say," answered Mrs. Norton, "that my husband simply expresses the promptings of my own heart, and that I rejoice in the rela- tionship just discovered as one from which I anticipate the highest pleasure." "And I say," added the lovely daughter,   390 Ni HOW BENNIE DID IT. "th t I have never been so happy in my life; and- I can hardly conceive of any piece of intel- ligence that I could have received, no matter of wha; nature, that would have been more agree- able than that of to-day. I feel very rich- only child that I am, and with so very few juvenile kindred - in the little cousin-treasures I have found, and I know we will all be very happy together." She was certainly not more delighted than were, the little "cousin-treasures " themselves. The present position of affairs was to them so startling, and withal so full of everything which their bright imaginations could desire, that so far as they could see they had come in possession of the very thing which most they would have wished. Therefore the happiness was  pretty generally diffused, and  both families, in separating for the night, felt that the day had been one, that by even the young- est member of the company would never, be forgotten. =   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     391 Unconscious of the incidents of the day, Bennie, after tea, went forth to pass the even- ing with the NORTONS. "Ah, Master/Benjamin," exclaimed Mary, giving him a cordial greeting, "we have some rare news for you." "Indeed, I am delighted to hear you say so," replied he, "for it is now so many days since I have heard anything new, and at the same time rare, as you say, that I am rather eager for something of the kind. Please tell me quickly." "Well, we have some new cousins in town I What say you to that?" "News, indeed, I say; for I have thought that you and I were about destitute of any such possessions, either here or anywhere else. Are they recently arrived?" "Not very; but by some means or other they are acquaintances of yours, and talk much about you." "Now you do interest me. Where do they come from?"  \   392 ,   HOW BENNIE DID IT. "From New York." "Indeed, 1 cannot imagine who they are." "So I suppose; but I am purposely with. holding their names with the hope that your wits will be sufficiently sharpened to under- stand to whom I refer." "For which I am sorry, for I have had so much to do to-day with such vulgar associations as corn, flour, and so forth, that I have no wits this evening, and came here with the hope that you would assist me in renewing my stock." "And you therefore admit that you can form no idea to whom I refer? '" "Not the slightest. Please relieve my grow- ing curiosity, and give me the names." "Let me try you a little longer. The party consists of four, a widow mother with three children, two of which are girls of about eight and ten years, of age." * It's no use; I 'm too dull." "Then you do n't deserve to be told. How- ever, with special pity for your corn-muddled condition, I'll help you out this time, hoping   RIOW BENNIE DID IT.    393 you'll be brighter in the future. Did you ever hear of a family such as I have described by the name of LISLE?" "LISLE!" exclaimed Bennie; "Mary Nor- ton, what do you mean?" 'Simply that in the Lisles we have found relations!" "Relations in the Lisles! Who? What?" cried he, springing to his feet, "what are you talking about?" "Please sit down, will you, and do n't be- come excited?" replied Miss Norton, amused beyond measure at his mainer, " and I'll tell you all about it. This afternoon, papa, mamma, and I visited the Lisles. You are of course aware that this was papa's first visit to them; and by a tact which neither you nor I, nor any one else, in fact, have been able to command he engaged Mrs. Lisle in such conversation as naturally had connection with her experience and history; and as she gave us one after another these incidents, making reference to her husband, her mother, her family name, and I   394    HOW BENNIE DID IT. so forth, papa's attention became so intense as to surprise us, and he asked question after ques- tion with such rapidity and earnestness that we could see that some strange idea had taken possession of him; and you may judge what were our feelings when, after he had 'traced the connection beyond all doubt, he announced that the Lisles and we are cousins! What think you of that?" "Well, well, well!" exclaimed Bennie with altone and manner of bewilderment, " can all this be a reality, or am I dreaming?" "I can say this much," answered Mary, "I never saw you look so dreamy before." "Indeed you may say that safely, for it seems next to impossible for me to take in the idea that all this can be anything more than a dream; and yet you will remember that I have more than once spoken of the remarkable resemblance between yourself and Nenie, which certainly could not be more striking if you were sisters. But here comes the question again, as though it would not be silenced, can   HOW BENNIE DID IT.    395 it be that you and she are related as you say? What an item for the newsmongers and even for the newspapers; what a pretty little chapter on which to build a story of romance I I am growing impatient to see them all, for l fancy they will all appear so different, and that I will experience such a new and peculiar in- terest in them."  Well; we will give you an early opportunity for being with them, for they will be here to-morrow evening, and you know we will all be happy to have you join us at the tea table." "And I shall be happy enough to be a party in the pleasure of such an occasion, although  s     \ were it not that my acquaintance with them has been just what it has, I would feel that my pres- ence would be an intrusion. But, under the cir- cumstances, I assure you I will look forward to . the hour with specially pleasant anticipations." Bennie and Mary had in-the Lisles an almost inexhaustible theme of conversation for the evening, and the former was' peculiarly happy   396    HOW BEVNNIE DID IT. in the thought that in himself, humanly speak- ing, had been commenced the train of circum- stances whence all this delightful denouement had been brought about; and when the two separated for the evening, it was with the renewed expression of gratitude that to them had been given the disposition and the oppor- tunity to be engaged in such work as they felt would surely receive the commendation of Him who " went about doing good."   CHAPTER XV. I5  IT is not necessary that we should particu. I;    slarly speak of the incidents of the -follow ing evening at the hospitable .home of Mr. Norton. The reader will not be slow to be- lieve that Bennie, just as :he expected to be, was one of the happiest members   of the party. But it would be difficult to determine which of all who were there was really the happiest, for from the honored host, the eld- est, to the rosy little Willie, the youngest of the company, every heart appeared full to the brim with joy. The occasion was one so extraordinary that, apart from the mere social delights which- such a little party would any time naturally enjoy while together, tLfere was a peculiar fund in the circumstances of the meeting from which all could draw rare and inexpressible pleasure. It is, however, prob-   398    HOW BENNIE DID IT. ably not too much to say, that within the heart of the hitherto sad mother, whose' little ones were so suddenly drawn from their condition of need and placed where comforts and friends would be at their command in abundance, there were stirred emotions of gratitude, commingled with joy, such as no other member of the company could experience. Ah, how great, as well as unexpected to her was the change which a few short hours had made I What a relief to the anxieties of mind, and what a burden had been taken from her overladen and aching heartl She was happy indeed, more than she could have expressed, and more than any other one present could have appre- ciated if she had expressed. Nevertheless, the whole company was entertained and delighted beyond all expectation by her intelligent and glowing converse, and the NORTONS were in- creasingly assured that in her, as a relative and associate, they had one of whom they might indeed be proud. *    *    *    *    *   I HOW B EYNIE DID IT.  399 There came now very decided changes in the circumstances of the LISLES. From the lone and humble room which for months had been tlheir home, they^ were transferred to a comfort- able house, not far from Mr. Norton's, which was furnished by him in such a style as his generous nature and  kind heart at once prompted. Indeed, ample as were his means, he would have placed the family not only in a comfortable but an elegant home--for such an one they were well fitted to adorn-but Mrs. Lisle could not consent to his doing so. And  indeed, passing  through 'the scenes which she had during the few years past, she did not feel like putting herself in any posi- tion suggestive of display, nor where she would be expected to take a prominent part in a mere formal life. And although Mr. Norton ac- cepted the family, in the condition he found tI   them, as providentially committed to his care, to be provided for by him as though they were his own; and although he would have freely done this, he nevertheless appreciated Mrs.   -400    HOW t BENNIE DID IT. Lisle's delicate taste in the matter, and situated her in the way imost agreeable to her wishes. But Mrs. Lisle was not long in learning that although she had preferred an inconspicuous position, she was not to be permitted to main- tain it. As a close relative of the Nortons, she- would of course be quickly surrounded by visitors and friends; and with a family so in- tercsting as. hers, it was only to be expected that there would- be many who would be at- tracted to them as fast as their history was known. But apart ftiom all this, the mother possessed in herself everything that was cal- culated to make her a feature of increasing interest in the circle to which she was now in- troduced. The intelligent and the brilliant gathered about her, enjoying themselves with the intellectual repasts afforded by her com- panionship; and in all the varied list of those who were continually seeking her society and friendship, there were none but were fascina- ted, benefited, and increasingly anxious to come again.   It         O tOW BENNIE DID IT.   401 And to the children too, there came of course their full ratio of happiness and bless- ing. Placed at once in such schools as afforded the amplest advantages, both of educa- tion and companionship, they made rapid  advance. To them the days and weeks came and went, lighted with sunshine and crowned with joy i care and sorrow, hunger and tears, had departed from their fireside, and gladness had assumed the place. Their studies, their recreations, and even theirhildish play s were assisted, participated in, and lightened by Ben- nie and , cousin Mary," both of whom felt themselves ever repaid for all they did- to ren- der the little ones- happy. And as companions for his brothers and sisters, Bennie well enough knew that the associations were as helpful as could be wished, consequently the fields of profit and pleasure to him and his were only enlarged as the result of the interest he had taken in-the Lisles. And among other firm friends which the fam- ily had made, and who clung to them with an 26   402    HOW BENNIE DID IT. increasing pleasure, was Mr. Wilson. To hir the delight would have been beyond expression had circumstances been so different that thi Lisles would have been ascertained to be hi kindred as they were Mr. Norton's; and it fact, while he could but congratulate the family and Mr. Norton too, on the whole develop. ment, there was with him nevertheless a feeling of disappointment when he heard the news. For he had already shaped up for himself a T    succession of pleasures in taking the family, if agreeable to them, under his special care, and providing liberally for them out of the abun- dant wealth with which God had blessed him. In imagination he had already been delighted with thoughts of them in a comfortable home, the mother freed from the cares which' had oppressed her, and the children being so edu- cated as to fit them for fulfilling aright the duties of life. However, for their sakes, he was gratified that the result was what it was; and while they would not now need the same kind of friendship from him which he had pur-   HO W BENNIE DID IT.    403 posed, they were nevertheless constant recipi- ents of all such attentions as were admissible, and rapidly learned to respect and love him as a friend most highly to be prized. *,    * t . 8Se Here will occur a lapse in our story. Not but that there is much of interest which we might have continued to relate in connection with the daily history of the parties of whom we are writing, but because, for the purpose of our story, there is much that may be passed. Understand, therefore, that some years in the history of Bennie and his friends have now gone by, as we resume our story. In the mean time, all the parties continued diligent in ",every good word and work," have been adding to their own joys, as well as min-. istering to the joy of others. The familiar office of Mr. Wilson is, as it ever has been, the scene of business activity, where unremittingly day after day he and Ben, nie have wrought together in their respective duties, and at the same time have welded   404    HOW. BENNIE DID IT. stronger and stronger the bonds which has bound them as friends. "]ihave a special communieeiint make I you, Benjamin," said Mr. Wilson one. pleasai morning as the two were alone together in th office, "' and which is nothing more nor less tha that I intend to retire from business." "Mr. Wilson!" exclaimed Bennie, startle at the announcement, and not knowing whf reply to make. "This surprises you, does it?" "Indeed sir, it does, more than I can e: press. You are not a very old man, and ar yet full of energy." "True, but I have an abundance of wealtl and in attendance to my personal property feel that I have an increasing and alread sufficient demand upon my time and energ I    too to make it proper- that I should throw ol other obligations. My income now, as yo I     know, is great, and I need more time to use it. :"May I ask," said Bennie, interrupting hin 1"how you could more profitably use it tha   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     405 you do? There is certainly not an investment    which you make, nor an enterprise in which you engage, that fails to make a most liberal i   return." "You are correct enough, my boy, but this is FI  the trouble. Now the question is, is it proper that I should go on in this way, allowing my energies and time to be so much occupied with these investments, accretions, and cares, when there is doubtless so much good that can be done, and so many needy who may be helped, if instead of waiting for, I seek out opportuni- ties of usefulness and blessing?" "An important question to decide, sir," re. plied Bennie, "and I am inclined to the opinion that you are about to decide it in the right way.  Wealthy   men, doubtless, -often  do wrong, and deny themselves very much happi- ness in leaving their benefactions to the charge of their executors instead of being their own executors, and making their lives the daily wit- nesses of their charities. Could many of those who have postponed their work to be accom-   406    HOW BENNIE DID IT. plished by others have known the miseries that might have been spared had they worked while they lived, and could they too have foreseen the wicked perversion of their charity funds after they were dead, I think there is not one but would have done themselves what they left to others! F-day, for instance, you might be the means of untold blessing to many a family who otherwise will suffer. What good will it do them to be told that you have appropriated an extensive "poor fund," to be used when you are dead? And how careful ought men to be in this matter of shuffling off their duty thus, especially when, if they would but admit the truth, the whole thing is an evasion by which they wish to escape, effort themselves, and to hoard for their own selfish uses the money which at death they know they must give up! What astonishing liberality they exhibit, in giving what they can 't keep!" "Just the light exactly in which I have been viewing- the matter," replied Mr. Wilson; "and therefore I am decided that I will make no such   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     407 postponement, but will work 'while it is called to-day.' " , What do you design doing with your busi- ness, sir?" asked Bennie. "I intend taking down the sign of GEORGE WILSON, and 'substituting that of BENJAMN STOUT." Bennie was at once, too much overcome to speak. "O O my friend Mr. Wilson l" said he, when he could command himself sufficiently, "{ indeed, indeed, I thank you from my inmost heart; but this is too much, too muchl how can it be possible for me to become proprietor and head of such a house as this? I have not I    a tenth nor even a twentieth part of the means that are necessary to conduct the business!" But I have," quietly replied Mr. Wilson, "and I intend to place at your disposal all the funds that you may need to establish you, securely in the business, at an interest of six per cent, and payable five years from date. When this time will have come round, if your *        I        r   408    HOW BENNIE DID IT. life and health are spared, I know you will have made the money; but if not, I will make such provision as will secure you from embar- rassment, and see you safely through." Poor Bennie I was he dreaming, or was all this reality? He the head of the house of George Wilson! A young man not yet much more than out- of his "teens"l It was too grave a responsibility to be lightly assumed, and he was at a loss as to the propriety of ' accepting the flattering offer, notwithstanding the assistance that Mr. Wilson so kiidly pSro- posed to render. But, on the other hand, how could he refuse? The offer was made withl good intent, the business was under no embar- rassment, on the contrary, was in the hithest degree prosperous; he had fairly worked his way to such a position in the house as to bo already a mainstay in its management, anid Mr. Wilson was desirous to retire, - in the light of all which circumstances, what reason had' he to decline? Nevertheless, he very p-roperly   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     409 concluded that the matter was of too vast importance to be acted upon in a moment, and so told Mr. Wilson. Indeed, Mr. Wilson," said he, " favorable as this offer is, and one for which I can never cease to thank you, I must have a little time to consider it, and counsel with my father and the, family on the subject. True, they will doubt- less all suggest that my judgment will be of more value in the case than theirs; but at the same time there is a measure of respect and compliment due them from me which makes it proper that I consult with them before taking so important a step." "Just such a reply, Benjamin, as I expected you to mike, and such action on your part is of manifest propriety. The result, however, can be but one way, which will be just as I have arranged it, and only such as I have coiltem- plated for some time as the best token I could render of my appreciation of the faithfulness and efficiency with which you have unwaver- ingly served me these many years. You will   "O    HOW BENXIE DID IT. now have an abundant opportunity for full development of your capacity, energy. and marked Christian principle, in a sphere where I know your influence will be paramount for good." "But do you not fear," asked Bennie, " that this retirement from business, with the great change which it will make in your habits and occupations, will produce an unhappy effect upon you?" "I do not propose to make a change so sud- den as to work thus unfavorably. As long as it will be agreeable to you, my desk will remain just where it is, to be occupied by me as regu- larly as hitherto, and my counsel in business matters to be as fully at your service as though I were partner with you. Thus I will do no violence to my habits, and I will at the same time maintain a feeling of interest in the busi- ness that will be beneficial to us both." "Your plans for my happiness, Mr. Wilson," replied Bennie, "are indeed complete; for I can assure you that your vacant chair and desk    HOW BE2NIE DID IT.     4 " would have hardly allowed me to be reconciled to the change you contemplate in my behalf. But to have you steadily here, and with me, would be as a guarantee of both my success and pleasure. The whole prospect, however, is to me so unexpected and strange that I cannot easily yet say that I can accept anything that would sever the relationship so long and so happily maintained between us." "Natural enough that you should feel so, my boy, but it is full time that you were settled in life; and as I desire to see you so, and know not how soon I might be taken away, I wish to have the matter all satisfactorily arranged and yourself well established while I can." When Bennie seated himself again at his desk, he did so with the feeling that life had undergone a great change with him, even dur- ing the hour just past. ;The cosy corner which he had so long occupied, and where having written and planned,/ bought and sold, and wrought in general, free from the weighty re- sponsibilities, of proprietorship, now seemed   "2    HOW BENNIE DID IT. rising before him laden with important inter- ests and serious cares. No more- now would he go from it when the work of the day was done with a mind unburdened and free, for life's earnest warfare was just commencing, in -which battling thought and energy were to be marshalled continually upon the field, and to be ever on the alert.' But as he began to grow desponding with the prospect, hope came to the rescue, dispelling all apprehensions, and as if by magic changing the whole vision into a scene of triumph, in which himself stood crowned with the garlands of victory, welcomed and cheered by the congratulations of those interested in his success. Thus encouraged and relieved, he went home- ward happy. And as he went, how his heart swelled with delight as he thought of the pleasure to be experienced by the dear ones at home when he would tell them all. And how too, loomed up the future, as, in his new posi. tion, it would enable him to be for the family the instrument by which they could more freely   HOW BENNtE DID IT.     413" enjoy many consistent pleasures and comforts in life which for years they had been compelled to forego. Truly to hiU was this an hour of harvest, and the sickle was just going in upon a reaping of the glowing- crop for which he had faithfully toiled. ,Brother Bennie has something very pleas- ant to tell us this evening, I am quite sure," said his sister Susie, as the family gathered about the tea-table. "I believe that myself," replied her mother; "his tell-tale countenance certainly indicates the speedy forthcoming of some news that will give us pleasure. Look at his face, papa, and tell us what you think."   - "It's clear and sunny," said Mr. Stout, " and betokens fair weather." "Yes, papa, see, there's a rainbow, too, on mamma's face, made, I guess, by the light of Bennie's eyes, through some of the misty tears that are just saying good-bye," added Nellie. "You must be right, my darling child,"   "4    HOW BENNIE DID IT. quickly replied Mrs. Stout; " for mamma's hear is so happy this evening with all your brigh and loving faces about me, that the rainbow ol beautiful hope might well be seen on my face But I am increasingly confident that our Ben nie has something very interesting to communi cate, and I am anxious to know if our con jectures are correct." All eyes now turned upon Bennie, whose face was beaming with the joy of which his heart was full, and who was as i eager to tell as were the others to hear. "Yes," said he, "you are correct; I have something to tell; something very important and which I doubt not will delight you all My good friend Mr. Wilson has decided tc retire from business." "It don't delight me much to hear that." cried Susie, interrupting him.  "Nor me, either," added Nellie, with a dis. appointed look. But Mr. and Mrs. Stout said nothing just   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     415 then, for within their minds there arose quickly an inkling of something else that their son had to tell. L "And he is going to take down his old sign," continued Bennie, "and have a new one put up, which is to say on it, ' BENJAMN STOUT.' " Now came a scene of joy which we cannot properly describe. For a time the children were simply uncontrollable,' and gave vent to their happiness in all the conceivable forms of youthful exultation. But, oh I who can imagine the depths of the noiseless stream of gratitude that at that moment was moving within the hearts of the father and mother. Fully now were they realizing the truthfulness of the divine promises of honor and blessing to the parent and child who walk in the ways of wisdom and\depart notF therefrom. With all the pleasure, however, that, Mr. --Stout experienced at the announcement, he could nothut see at once that  the proposed change was one indeed of vast proportions, such as would involve all the energies of his   "6    HOW, BENNIE DID In: son's young manhood; and shape all the in. terests of his life; therefore, it is not strange that he did not make any extravagant demon. strations over the matter, but received the in. formation with a thoughtful blending of the feelings of pleasure and apprehension. "Has Mr. Wilson ever given you any intima- tion of such a purpose as this, my son?" asked Mr. Stout. "No, sir, not a word." -"And does he really propose to transfer the entire concern and business to you?" "Yes, sir." "Would it not be much   better that you accept an interest with him, without assuming the whole?" "That I would prefer; but he has evidently matured  his plans on a basis that looks to no such arrangement." "And how does he expect you to take such a concern, pay for even a tenth part of the pur. chase, and meet coming engagements?" "He proposes to put everything at my com- A?   HOW BENNIE DID IT.-     417 mand that may be necessary of business, money and influence, and to so situate me that with ordinary providential assistance I will be sub- ject to no embarrassment in the future." "A very liberal offer, indeed," said Mr. Stout; " but Mr. Wilson has his own way of doing things, and has thus far done everything with more than an average of success. The secret, however, my son, in the present case is this: God's word is overflowing with rich prom- ises of blessing for this life, as well as that to come, to those who delight themselves in tHis law and are rigidly governed thereby, without reference to the maxims and customs of men. Thousands of men, and boys too, fail, doubtless, of realizing the happiness and prosperity which they might, were they to take council less of their own inclinations and passions, arid more of Him who is all wisdom, and who I giv- eth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.' You, my son, I think I may say without vanity, have certainly been an exception, even in your boyhood, to the thousands around you. Those 2f    "8    HOW BENNIE DID IT. heavenly principles which your parents have I raycrfully striven to implant within your heart, s) that they should be with you the ' rule of life,' you have accepted, nurtured, and endeav- ored fearlessly to act upon in the current affairs of life. Thus you have stood upon a more elevated platform than many of your fellows, from which you have been able to take a less obstructed view of what was before you, and to bring to your aid the light which made your pathway clear when others walked in darkness. The prospect now before you, 't is true, is rare; but I confidently believe that many, nay all, might enjoy it equally with you, in quality if not in kind, were their lives and principles shaped in accordance with the law of God. Unbelief; however, chokes the truths that otherwise would bear their legitimate fruit, and men in their folly rave about their want of 'luck.' That some men who are governed by no Christian principle thrive in the affairs of this world is no arrgument against whlat I have said. Thrive they may, for reasons known only to Infinite   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     419 Wisdom; but their thrift, not having the bless- ing of God upon it, and accomplished by the various manceuverings and questionable opera- tions to which the unsanctified heart will resort, brings no such pleasure as you this evening enjoy. There is a canker at the root of their pleasure, for they Know that all has been gotten with reference to this life, and that soon they and it must part. Thus-thinking, the future portends misery, or uncertainty at best, all of which tends to dim their visions of the near future this side the grave. To Mr. Wilson, your course has been one so marked that he has been compelled to own the power of Christian principle; he recognizes the fact that there is not only a 'law of love,' but that its workings may be manifest even amid the! subterfuges of trade and life at large. As through your vital Christianity great things have been accomplished for him, he intends that the same power, through him, shall accom- plish great things for you. :Thus do the,   420     HOW BENNIE DID IT. believer's actions magnify the grace and law of God, and thus are we drawn nearer and nearer in heart and life to the perfection of the heavenly state." "Every word of which, my dear fathe," replied  Bennie, respectfully, "'do I fully indorse. And while we are now all rejoicing in the pleasant prospect before me in my business matters, and in which Jou are of course all as much interested as I, there can te no more fitting occasion for me to express to my father and mother the gratitude of my full heart that they were steadfast in their efforts to train me in the ways of righteousness. I am certain there will never be for me any greater pleasure than in devoting myself to you, and in using every effort by which I may make cheer ful and bright for you the evening of life." "Bless you, bless   you, my noble boy," J exclaimed his mother, throwing her arms about his neck, while the  tears of joy streamed i free upon her cheeks, "you are a comfoit and a treasure indeed, and may God the Lord be   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     421 your God, your Guide, and your Salvation through Jesus Christ, His precious Son, is your mother's earnest prayer." 8    e    *    * The evening was yet young, although the family had much to talk about in connection with the matter before them, and Bennie concluded to share his pleasure with certain other friends whom he knew would be inter- ested in learning the events of the day. To have accepted any such important proposition as the one before him without the advice and approbation of his friend Mr. Norton, he would hlave considered entirely wrong. It is not therefore strange that we now see him on his way to that gentleman's house to tell the news and receive the congratulations that he was confident awaited him. And as in the matter there would be questions of an exclusively business character that must be discussed, he called for Mr. Norton alone. The tale was soon told; and Bennie was not disappointed in the hearty congratulations   422    BOW BEENNIE DID IT. - he expected to receive from his friend. But he was somewhat surprised when he learned that Mr. Norton had known all, and that Mr. Wil- son had been to him for all the information that was necessary to properly consummate the transaction. "It is an important day in your history, Benjamin," said Mr. Norton, "and the one from which is to 'branch out very many of the inter-' esting associations of your life; and according as you may now improve the great trust to be committed to you will be your answer in the day of accounts. Danger now besets you, as  never before, and you will need, therefore, the grace of God to keep you strong. Your heart might easily be puffed up by the novelty and  conspicuous character of your new situation; but our hope and prayer is, that you will feel your responsibility as a Christian, and so deport yourself as to be a living illustration of the strength and beauty of the religion we profcss." !"My thanks to you, Mr. Norton, I can but   ! poorly express," replied Bennie; "and as I look   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     423 back to the days of my Sabbath school, and the instructions of my honored teacher, and there- from through all your subsequent interest in me, I feel indeed that a Christian friend is more to be prized than treasures of gold." "In so far, Benjamin, as God has made me the instrument of good to you, or for you, I feel that I too have much for which to be thankful to Him. There is a pleasure in unsel- fish labor for others too great for words to ex- press; but the strange blindness of our natures prevents us too much from putting forth, the efforts that are necessary to attain this pleasur- able end. Self is the great attraction, and therefore for self we are prone to labor, only to receive the unsatisfactory reward which is sure to come. But that happiness which is be- yond comparison is when, sanctified thereto by the grace of God, the heart, the life, the all, is consecrated to Christ, and labors continually and earnestly for the interests and upbuilding of His kingdom in the world. But enough of   424    HOeW BLENNZ DID it. this just now. I am anxious to know how your friiends at home regard the step which Mr. Wilson proposes." "They are of course delighted so far as they can judge of the prospects. My father, how- ever, knowing more of the responsibilities as well as perils that must be encountered in such a position is not without apprehension that they may be greater than I ought to assume. But as the circumstances are such as they are, he feels that I would be doing wrong to iMr. Wilson as well as myself by declining; and I am relieved in believing that you are of the same opinion." "You certainly may be," replied Mr. Norton, "and I doubt not that you may consider that all your friends will coincide with me." "May I ask, Mr. Norton, if Mrs. Norton and Mary have been informed of the matter?" "My wife has," was the reply, "but Mary has not. We thought it would be better to say nothing to her or others until it was decided."   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     425 "Then, with your consent," said Bennie, "I would like the pleasure of being myself her informant." {'That pleasure you may have," answered Mr. Norton, rising to go and call his daughter, "and you may expect to receive some very earnest congratulations from her in view of your brilliant prospects." A friend of yours is in the drawing-room, my daughter," said her father entering the library where Mrs. NMorton and Mary were reading, " and seems to be in a peculiarly liappy mood too, I think, this evening. He did n't say that he preferred seeing you alone, but I rather infer that he does. There is, how- ever, no special need for those gathering blushes," continued her father, playfully tap- ping her cheek, "for he said nothing calculated to excite them." "I believe that my dear father takes a special pleasure in arousing the blushes on every available opportunity, nevertheless," re- plied she, crimsoning deeper than before; " but   426    HOW BENNIE DID IT. I suppose that such cruelties our poor sex must submit to with as good a grace, and complain as little, as possible. But you have n't yet told me who the friend is?" "Ask your cheeks," answered her father with a provokingly amused manner; " there can be no doubt of their giving you the truth." "Do, husband, let the child alone," inter- posed Mrs. Norton, coming to her daughter's relief; at just which time " the child " made her escape. "Do you remember, Mary," said Bennie, shortly after she was seated, "that one evening some time ago you had some very special news to tell me, which instead of telling at once you inhumanly proposed that I should guess out for myself?" - "Yes."., "Well, I am happy to say that I have a rare opportunity for retaliation;' for I have some very important news, such as I think you will be greatly interested in hearing, and I propose ,    Row BENNIE DID -T.     427 that you shall now exercise 'your wits' in guess- ing out what it is." "You are cruel l" "No doubt of it. But you, I suppose, on the other occasion were not!" "I gave you something as a clue upon which to try your wits, but you have given me nothng." "Well, my news is connected with busi- ness." "Pshaw! -the same old dry, commonplace topic! Well, I can guess it easy. Mr. Wil- son proposes to make you a partner." "Wrong. Try again." "Proposes to you to open a corresponding house in the Indies, or some other heathen country." "Not right yet. Try again." "Proposes that you take a modest little house in the city, and commence business for yourself." "Wrong again, although I must confess that you have a fertile brain for devising some   428    HOWr BErENNIE DID IT. business proposition which might naturally e  made. Do you give it up?"        ; "Well, I don't like to; but you know that business is not much in the line of my know. ings or likings, and therefore I can only go about as far as I have, for want of business knowldclge sufficient to enable me to frame something to guess about. I think I'll have to give it up, althougih I wont consent to lay the blame to my wits." "I'll confess that you have done better than I did," said Bennie, "and deserve to be kept on the rack no longer; so here's the news. It is very probable that if you should be pass- ing along by No. 77 Court street a few days hence, you would see over the door the name of BENJAMN STOUT just in the place where you have always seen that of GEORGE WIL. SON "    .  The enthusiastic girl sprang from her seat and clapped her hands with the greatest glee.  "O Bennie, Bennie!" cried she, ;how can that bt? What does it mean? I an 't under.   i   I.   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     429 stand it. Tell me all about it, quick; for indeed, such news delights me, as well as sur- prises me, more than I can tell." So he " told her all about it, quick." "News, indeed I " said she, when he nad con- cluded; "news indeed, and you spoke truly enough in saying that it was such news as I would be greatly interested in hearing. OQh, how sincerely do I congratulate you, anld -how very much, for your sake, do I thank Mr. Wil-e . son for this noble act in your behalf. It is one, \: the thought of which must surely prove to him an unspeakable and life-long pleasure." "But I have still faurther news to tell you? and of just as much importance." "More news!" exclaimed she, with an expres- sion of intense surprise: " don't then, I beg of you, compel me to guess it out!  "No, I will not, Mary, but will simply tell you what I have never felt myself in cireum- stances to do before, that 1 love you very much." ; Her eyes fell suddenly to the floor, a:id the , -- I,!   430    HO W BENNIE DID IT. deepest blushes so crimsoned her cheeks and temples that to Bennie she seemed unspeakably lovely. But in a moment or two he observed, starting and deepening on her countenance, a smile of such singular and mischievous charac- ter as to kindle within him certain sensations of misgiving such as were not agreeable, to say the least. "Did you not say that you had more neuws to tell me?" asked she, her whole countenance aglow  with an expression that made Bennie increasingly uneasy. "Yes," replied he, apprehensively. "But that is no news." "No news I  Why not?" *"Because it's something Iknew  long, long ago," replied she, with a  manner that only added to Bennie's alarm. "You did I  I would like to know how?" "Don't ask such nonsensical questions, Ben- nie.  Has a  woman no special intuitions in such matters?"

Beaming with a tenderness of affection that could only be kindled by a heart true and earnest as hers, her eyes met his, and laying ^ her hand in his, she replied, - "And I, dear Bennie, love you with a devotion as entire as your fondest desires can wish." Somehow or other Bennie just then felt as   I; though a mountain had been detached from the vicinity of his heart, and' was rolling far, far  away. Never had he done so imprudent a thing before; but by some strange impulse the lovely girl was pressed to his heart, her lips were made sensible of .a sensation of thrilling delight, and after a while he bade her good    . night and went home, more happy than he would have known how to express.         ! v -I- ,'  ' .    CHAPTER    XVI. DEFORE many days had gone by, people were greatly surprised at the pew  sign whichl had gone up over the door at No. " Court street, and which only said "BENJAMN STOUT."             ! "How can it be possible?" said sonje. "Where did he get the money?" saiil others. "Why did Mr. Wilson give up entir?" said more. The newspapers gave all the information that was necessary, which was, that ,' Mr. George Wilson, thankful for the long continued pros- perity with which he had been favored, had retired from active business, leaving as-his suc- cessor, Mr. BENJAMN STOUT, who had so long been with him in a confidential position in' the house, and whor he commended to its patrons."   oW O BENNIE DID IT.    433 The affair created no small amount of sensa- tion in the business circles, and the congratu. lations poured in upon Bennie from every quar. ter, accompanied with hearty assurances of assistance in every way that would tend to per- petuate the prosperity which the house had so long enjoyed.  Mr. Wilson was made very happy too, by the abundant commendations which were tendered him for his generous treat- ment of Bennie; a good work, by the way, which he did not content himself by performing towards Bennie alone, for he kept continually mindful of all the deserving ones who had been in his employ, and -assisted them from one posi- tion to another. until all were comfortably established in life. Days and months rolled on, and Bennie had the most gratifying prospects in his business. Endorsed, as he was known to be, without limit by Mr. Wilson, he had every facility for working his energies to the best advantage, and it soon became an established fact that his house was destined to occupy the very first position in 28   434    HOW BENNIE DID IT. influence, high-toned liberality and integrity, and princely success. As to his position in society, conspicuous as he ever was as an attractive feature in its most intelligent and polished circles, he had everything that his heart could wish. -But surrounded as he was by such beloved ones as those of his own father's household, the' Nortons, the Lisles, among whom, ever dear, was the devoted Nenie, Mr. Wilson and others, his was indeed the happy lot that the true heart which has built itself on the foundations of God's word, the law of love, fails not to enjoy as simply that which it may confidently expect. But there is one more occasion in which we may see him, and on which it might be' said that his cup of happiness was full. A brilliant assemblage has gathered at the mansion of Mr. Norton on a bright evening in May. From far and near the guests have come, the poor, the rich, the good and the great. The occasion 'is one to which many minds have been turned for some time past   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     435 with the most delightful expectations; and it is one which all who are to be present expect not soon to forget. Illumined from foundation to roof, the old-mansion shines out conspicuous in a way uncommon; and crowds who are- not invited guests have gathered about it to tender their unsought congratulations to the honored host whose name and fame are in honor in the whole community.' And what is the secret of it all? Simply that the lovely daughter, who is the manlsion's brightest light, is this evening to become the wife of the rising young merchant, BENNIE STOUT! And it was indeed a sight not soon to be forgotten which that gay company looked upon when the doors were thrown back and that tableau of beauty burst upon the view. Gay indeed was tho cortege that was in attendance upon the principal parties in the scene; but in it all there were none who could compare with the beautiful and lovely girl who there awaited the solemn ceremony that was to unite her with the first love of her heart, and make them hus-   436     HOW BENNIE, DID IT. band and wife. And in him whom she liad thus chosen,she felt that her trembling liand rested upon the arm of one whose was a rlanly, noble, and Christian heart, and of whom she knew she might indeed be proud. The marriage ceremony proceeded, and when tile minister pronounced upon the young couple benediction and congratulation, every heart and tongue promptly responded "Amen." But in the midst of all the congratulation and joy, the whole company was startled with astonishment and surprise at hearing the voice of the officiating clergyman saying,- "The remaining couple who propose pI esent- ing themselves to assume the matrimonial rela- tion will please do so now." Never before was such a company so in- tensely excited. Even Bennie and Mary, thus far the "observed of all observers," were for the moment forgotten; and as they were as much in the dark a's to what the announcement meant as were nearly all who were present, they even forgot themselves, and turned their   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     437 eyes inquilingly over the company to see who it could be to whom the minister referred. , But who can describe the intensity of excite. ment which pervaded the entire assemblage, when, fi'om a distant corner of the parlors, was seen forcing his way to where the clergyman was standing Mr. George W ilson, with the still 'beautiful widow, Mrs. Lisle, hanging on his arm? It now  began to be a question whether the latter couple were not likely to carry off the palm in producing the greater sensation of the evening; for the enthusiasm rose so high as to find expression in such rounds of applause that for a time the minister was unable to pro- ceed. And it was certainly a most interesting and impressive sight to see this couple, com- pared as they might be to two vessels that had been tossed and driven by the storms of a long and perilous voyage, now side by side coming safely to anchor in a  harbor, of rest. They, too, were greeted by the unaffected "Amen " that had been responded for Bennie and Mary,   438'    HOW BENNIE DID IT. after the solemn vows had been exchanged and the minister's benediction pronounced. We have not the ability to describe the scene that ensued when the ceremony was concluded. Forgetting all about themselves, Bennie and Mary had steadily pressed through the crowd until they stood side by side with Mr. Wilson and his bride, ready at the first moment to cast themselves upon them with the exuberant con. gratulations that came gushing from their young, warm hearts; and what painter could impart the touches that would be necessary to represent the surprises and delights that kin- dled upon the countenances of Bennie and Mary, Mr. and Mrs. Norton, Mr. Wilson and his bride, Nenie, Nettie and Willie, Mr. Stout and family, as they recognized in the work,of this evening that which constituted them kindred as well as friends! And now, for the present, with a- regretful parting, we must bid them all good-by. At   HOW BENNIE DID IT.     439 any time, however, when we may wish to look in upon them, we will find them, each in his or her respective sphere, faithfully and happily fulfilling their mission in life, laboring for the dethronement of selfishness, and seeking ever to follow the example of Him " who went about doing good." And to the young reader, who may either see or hear of the large and influential business house of Benjamin Stout, wielding as it does,' such a power in the community, we would say, ponder carefully this history, and you will know "How   BENNIE DID IT."

As to its contents-the fruits of sound judgment and good taste, as well as a devout spirit-they are purely devotional; consisting of se- lected and original hymns, prayers, sentences, etc., designed to aid In the cultivation of a devotional spirit, and in the expression of devout feelings, morn- ing and evening, and on special occasions." - Bston Traveller. "We have received from Hoyt, Fogg & Breed, Port- land, advance sheets of their beautiful flew volume, entitled ' Helps at the Mercy Seat.' This book of devotions meets in full the promise of its title. The judicious and appropriate selections from the holy Scriptures, and from the religious poetry of our own and other days, cannot fail, if duly perused andipon- dered, to fan the flame of devotional feeling, and prepare the mind for intercourse with God. It sup- plies the best materials of thought. It suggests the strongest motives to gratitude and praise. It em- bodies the best results of Christian experience, and will be a welcome auxiliary to all who desire to walk    :"th-God, and by fellowship with Him to learn how to walk consistently and usefully with men."-- Watchman and Reflector. "Messrs. Hoyt, Fogg & Breed, of this city, have just published a beautiful volume of devotional exercises, consisting of original hymns and selections in prose and verse, by the Rev. John M. Putnam, of Yarmouth, entitled 'Helps at the Mercy Seat.' The prose selec- tions are mainly from the Bible, but include also prayers by Thomas a Kempis, St. Bernard, Fenelon, Jeremy Taylor, Pascal and others. The hymns are - selected with care and taste. Among the American authors are Alice Carey, Mrs. Sigourney, Bryant, and S. F. Smith; and among the English names are Moore, Proctor (father and daughter), Charles Wesley, Keble, and Newton. Bowring's splendid lyric, ' In the Cross of Christ I glory,' and St. Bernard's exquisite hymn, ' For thee, O dear, dear country, mine eyes their vigils keep,' are among the gems of the collection. -Mr. Putnam's original hymns are clear and musical expres- ,sions of thoughts, which are none the worse for every day use, because they are as old as human nature. The book is elegantly printed by John Wilson & Son, of Cambridge, on tinted paper, with a rubricate title- page." - Portland Advertiser.

W. bARREN, DISTRICT SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN BOARD, Cloth, 16mo. 324 pages. Pour Illustrations. $1.25. Rev. Dr. A. P. Peabody says: "Rev. Mr. Warren's 'Twelve Years with the Children' is an admirable book of its kind., and its kind is among the -best kinds. It bears the marks of the godly simplicity and kindness which have won for him a place in the hearts of chil- dren. In its form it will attract juvenile readers, and in its spirit it cannot fail of enduring benefit to large numbers of the now rising generation." Dr. A. C. Thompson, Boston Highlands, says: "'Twelve Years with the Children,'-years of great plenty, well registered, cheery, juicy, 'having borne twelve manner of fruits.' In such company and work, the author keeps himself young, and helps others to keep young too. This work should have a place in our homes and Sabbath-schools, till the Saviour's last command has been fulfilled." "A wiser, more, genial man for the preparation of such a book it would be hard to find. Here are stories, beautifully applied and improved, about Crossing the River, The Wrong Car, The Launch, The Gold Dollar, The Dialogue, The Wild Children, The Heathen Girl, The MicB, How a Boy got his Money, etc. The mot- toes which these stories illustrate are, 'Begin right,' ' Do your best,' 'Do as you would be done by,' 'Do as you will wish you had done when you come to die.' What parent does not wish to have his children inter- ested and established in these great principles?"-- Congregational Review, Boston. "The Rev. W. Warren's Twelve Years with the Children' is an ingeniously interesting volume, and for some grown people as well as for little folks. Four mottoes are chosen: (1) 'Begin right,' (2) ' Do your   best,' (3) ' Do as you would be done by,' (4) ' Do as you will wish you had when you come to die '; then a great many facts and incidents, many of them drAwn from the mission work with which the author has had large familiarity, are given as echoes of, or responses to, or endorsement upon these mottoes; and with this warp of the book the - filling' is interwoven. Beginning thus, and having this always before him as an end, he has been led to a comprehension of child-nature and child:needs, which gives him command -of a style, simple and comprehensible, yet often graphic and im- pressive, and which has led him to write, in this, what seems to us to be a very good book indeed, for Sabbath- schools, for families, and for individual reading. It is a safe book, for it is the outhreathings of a heart which loves Christ, and would lead to Christ; and that is mbre than can be said of scores even of the professional Sabbath-school books of the day." - Congregationalist. ' To the many who know the excellent and genial author of this volume, it will need no recommendation, as they will recall his pleasant and stimulating talks at once, and be eager to get the large number of them, heard and unheard, that are found, in all their fresh- ness and vivacity, between these covers. "'To those who have not seen and heard him, we may say that this volume is brimful of excellent coun- Bsls, pithy sayings, stories that have both a meaning and a moral; familiar talks, that are sure to reach both brain ant heart, and encouragement to ' trust in the Lord and do good,' that will be found both cheering and useful.                    \ "Most of what here appears is especially adapted to children, but few are either so old or so wise as to be beyond the reach of the author's far-reaching aim and steady reach after usefulness. It is a book to stir bet- ter purposes and higher ambition, and make the heart abound still more in charity and hope." - Morning Star.
