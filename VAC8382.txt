Thomas looked abished, but when his part-
ner in business demanded anew, "What will
ye do wid it, Thomas?" he replied, "'m
studyin'2"
"The saints help ye, man, who ever heard
the like?" said Mrs. Iiliigan, stopping with
the han half in one of the baskets.
"It isn't justly what you might expect,"
said Thona,       ! rtcoring his composure, "hbut
'm favorable to it. There's a gentleman, a
real out and outer too, he's up in the Sem.

he's teaching me and I shall know the books
rightly soon."
"An' slackin' up the business, an' Il lose
money by yer airs," said Mrs. Kiliigan, wrath.
fudly, putting biscuits wherever she found
room in the hampers.
"It's 'idle time I take and I'll not los a

your luck, Mrs. Killigan, and you'll never find
a better pardner than ThomdTwic

" That car be," sadMrs. Kifliga, "but I
isdouht the books. Can ye read?"
"Right smartly," said Thomas, wh&amp;- was
onl of adverbs. " Next week I'm going inno

And what may that be, Thomas ?"
SWhy it's piece of the Bible, pardner.
" May the  intakepTyonaye heTihlom;

of the evil one himself," cried Mrs. Kiigan.
"I know bater, said Thomas; "my grand-
mother read it, and she had no dealings with
the evil one: ;your speaking by your priest,
pardner. and they'd take the last penny you
earn byv your baking.
- They won't get much out of me, mavrom
neen," said Mrs. Iilligan, shutting the baskets,
with a chuckle like the rttle of loose coppers
in a purse: "but let well enough alone, and
don't tempt thrial by the Bible."

upon whom the aristocratie inhabitants of the
house where Mr. Twizz lived, Lioktd down
with vast contempt. Mr. Twist: e neountered a
woman caring a little bundi of kindlings,
for which she had paid two cents.
"Good morning, Mrs. Dd'" said our
friend; "you're out early."

to do, and must make the rent somehow; the
old woman daunders over her knitting so oky

" Poor soul!-" saidThoma, "and you've
set up little Maggie with picks to sell.- She's
small for the street."

sai Mrs.Dodd. " Itold her I-bate her the
night an' she didn't earn more for ne."
I wouldn't do it" said Thoma, "she's
little and timid for the street; you don't know
what it is, Mrs. Dodd, you never had to do it
"No more I didn't'" cried Mrs. Dodd.

for not earning much ; she's not six year old,
v-mn."
"Thrue for ye, it's hard lines, but other bits
of childer earns more."
"Steal it more likely, and you wouldn't
want to drive her to that by being hard."
"No more I wouldn't," said Mrs. Ld.
"I want no thieves nor hieveries around me
-drnken ones is enough-- Dodd sucks up
the whiskey like a sponge the weather, bad luck
to him. I'm clean discouraged."
"I-believe it," said Mr. Twigg, heartily.
"I m sorry for you, woman. I wish I knew
ome comfort for you, but I reckon there ain't
any for poor folk, but /to drudge it out as siff
as we can, and die some day"
t     "Arrah, the time is long," said Mrs. Dodd,
climbing the steep staircase toward her room,
while Mr. Twigg went off bent, but brisk of
tep toward tnion Square.

gold, fair Tadmor, like a vision of beauty in
the wilderness, had written, "So I returned
and csdr  ed j all the oppresionshat are
done under the sun ; and behold the tears- of
such as were oppressed, and they had no cen-
forter?"
He who had seen Jesus in gory as he wem
to Damascus, who had keen lifted up to tdx
"third Heaven "      the .rapturous love
the Saviour, had caught up the refrain of
Solomon, and spoken of  God that comforttf
those that are cast down;u" hut while Mr
Twigg took the same view of the case of the
poor as Solomon, setting forth his wonderment
in homely phrase, he had never heard of
God as "God that comforteth," nor of -the
"Holy Ghost the Comforter," nor of Jesus
who invites the "weary " to his Rest.
Thomas thought earnestly and walked quick-
jy, and at last reached his place of husineM

on Union Square; he never got to it be
loked at it with pride.   Weather stained
boards made up the bark and two sides of his
stall, also the sloping roof; in front, sheltered
by the roof was a kind of counter, at the bark
a few shelves, and the place to stand between
the shelves and counter was narrow exceed-
ingly; it was a good thing that Mr. Twigg was.
not a larger man.
Mr. Twigg got behind his counter, lifted up
the i d which had been fastened with a s
padlock. and began to arrange his stock in
trade. He had two little furnaces on whih
he heated coffee and water ; he had also a litd
green tub wherein he washed his dishes,
a brown towel to wipe them. He had
jars of eandy, some nuts and apples, a
stock of crockery also. He set his merchan-
dise on the shelves, put his dishes in
the ham,  iesLLC th    e

that b et 'ise     and hanseleepers fat dL~

Then, as passers by began to multiply, Mr.
Twigg, for his own refreshment, and the better
advertising of his humble restaurant, poured
out a cup of black coffee, sweetened it with a
black sugar, the deposite of molasses barrels
cut some bread and ham, and proceeded to eat
his breakbst.   He ate with   great gasto,
kia'his lips, eyeing his coffee like aCon-
lisseur, and lovingly regarding the ham; thi,
prtly because he was hunzrv and hearty, and
 s ishedwhat he ate, and partly because it was

newspaper puff for    Corner Stal of Mr.

As he ate, a new thought struck Iha;
he got down under his shelves to rummage a
minute, and emerged with his spelling book
rescued from the basket. He opened the book,
and skSwly moved his fing*er down the pages.
"Ah," he said "1 knew it; b-r-ea-d-
bread,. there you are," and he poked abc
in a jocular way ; "e-o-d4e-e - cofee,then
you are,  and he put his cup to his
Then he walked his cup and plate, looked
about for a customer, sold two mites of
cakes for a penny, and turned to a little
er sewed into the leaves of his book ; it
a Track Society Primer, hut Thomas was
ightfulv oblivious of that Tract Society, far
wi h a Christian people has so much cause to

"That was doing a mighty sight," said Mr.

Thomas, cheerfully.

of the- stall, and the money the boot blacks

Thomas sold some lemonade to a nurse maid,
and some painted candy which she wanted to
keep her little charge quiet, while she gossiped
with her cronies in Union Square. Mr. Alls-.
ton looked at the delicate little ones, and won-
dered what their mother would say to see
the eain .the ;nfe4rir ndy trom the~ stall
of Thomas Twig. He then read a little to
Thomas, and Thomas read too; they were
reading the Gospel according to Mark. The
lesson being finished, Mr. Allston went away.
The next visitor, at the Corner Stall, wasb
little Magie Dodd. She looked very forlorn,
aying she had sold but three picks. She held
out her little box to Thomas; it had in it about
thirty picks. made of white bone, with two
little blades to them.
"They're fire cents apiece," said Maggie,
"an' nobody won't buy any. I wisht I was

like them children in the Square.   dont
have no good times; home pappy's drunk, and
grannie's mourning, and the baby squa a
straight streak. I wouldn't mind so much
onIy I don't never get enough to eat;" and
Magie eyed Thomas' wares, remembering
the promise of the turnover.
Thomas was not stingy, neither was he
forgetful; he gave Maggie the turnover, and
ste ate it with as satisfaction, never thinking
of finding fault because it was several days
old, had a tough crust, and was scantily fu
nished with sugar.  Apple turnover wa a
ra'ity that did not come to Maggie every days
and he accepted it accordingly.
"Now. Magie,     said Thomas, when the
last crumb of the turnover had disappear
"Eo into the Square, and ask every grown up
one vou meet to huy a pick, then walk all
round the Square and do the same."
"Tm afraid, folks look so sharp at me, sa
Maggie.

"Come, now, you'll-never get on in trade
if you mind that!" cried Thomas; "runoff
like a little woman ; hold up that long frock
of yours, voull tumble on it; your mother
ought to take a reef in it."
"She ain't no thread nor needle," said,
Maggie; "she wants to buy some."
"Go earn the money for her then; trot
along you poor little toad; vo'1 sell a heap
of picks before you get round the Square,
sure's my name's Thomas Twxgg, said the
pie-man, cheerfully.
Maggie gathered up her long frock in one
little brown hahd, pulled her hood farther on,
and clasped the corners of her shawl in the
hand that held the uncovered box of picks.
Thomas looked after her, going timidly up to
one and another, generally turned off with a
gnick shake of the head. One old gentleman,
with a gold headed cane and gold rimmed eve
glass, seemed quite angry at being asked to
buy.

"Like's not he' got a gold pick in his

friend's progress, "hbut land o' Goshen ! he
must have a stun for a heart, to refuse such a
poor weazen faced little toad as that, out hunt-

Zweepers were eioying such financial success

Maggie hurried along toward the "The St.

Nicholas$" where she had fhquently sold picks
to those who congregated about the door after
the dinner hour. She did not mean to stop
one moment until she got to this hotel, whose
grand white front always filled her poor little
heart with a sort of awe, but she did stop,
right near a fine window full of beautiful
French china. It was not the beauty of the
china that attracted Mazie, but looking into
the window was a little girl of her own age,
dressed in green velvet from her hat to her
gaiters; a cloud of wavy golden hair was
comled down over her shoulders, and her face
was fair and sweet as a moss rose. Behind
this little nurslinz of wealth stood a maid
ervant, holding the child's doll, a splendid
waxen affair, that seemed to Maggie almost as
beautiful as its owner; the child herself held a
mne Cornucopia, and was dividing her time
between looking in the window, and picking
out of the Cornucopia dainty confections such
nulease d her taste.

"Goody gracious, don't that gal have good
times!" said Maggie to herself; and just then
little miss looked at her, and cried out, "Janet

give her some god clothes?"

"Do coae on, Miss Mary," cried Jane,
if you want such a thing your pa 'Il get 'em
from the store; such beggars ain't fit for your

"I shall buy the pick," said Mary, "so you
can pay for it, Jane: do you like candy,
girl?"
Maggie nodded, though such candy as Mary
was eating se had never tasted1. Jane re-
lactantly paid fir the pick, which Mary pock-
ed with much deiht.
4'Hold out your box, girl," said Mary, "Il
gi1ve you some candy."
"Indeed, Miss Mary," cried Jane, "such
candy is not to be wasted on begars."
You keep still, Jane." said Mary, quickly,
"Ill do asI like to;" and she poured half her
candy into Magge's box, saying,  Tell me

"It's Maggie," said the little street gi
her eyes full of gratitude; "thank'ee, Miss "

must go on. I'll leave you, Miss, if you don't
Come."
The girl went, on, and her pretty charge
f slowed her slowly, while Maggie, putting
some candy in her mouth, and some in her
pocket. ran down the street.
While Maggie Was thus seeking her fortune
r alon  Broadway, Thomas, in his stall, on
Union Square, had another guest. The pie-
man kept his Testament in his hand, and when
not 1 u s with customers, studied it carefully;
L*vking up from his hook, he saw not far from
nim a pair of dark wolfish eyes, glaring upon
him in a way that made him quite uncom-
fortable. Of course the eves were set in a
c and that face was bleached and haggard,
U:ti the grim  genius of &amp;mine might have
taught it was his very self. About the face
hung shagy unkempt hair, and to be sure the
head was mounted on a body, and that body


was lank and loose jointed, and  eed cad in
a heterogeneous collection of old rags; here
looked out a sharp elbow, here a shoulder;
and there part of the side was bare, while
knees and feet and ankles were the prey of
every sleety wind that blew.
"Land Co Goshen'" cried Thomas, " Ratty,
is thatyou?"
"AYes it be," said the boy, shuffling a little
nearer.
"Why, Ratty,. what are you doing up here,
so far from the wharf?"
"I'm beat out " said Ratty, or rather Jer-
miali Hocknev. "Sumudy stole my money,
an' I got dared out of the house, an' Ie
slept in box'n, an' dodged the perlice, an' Ive
rigged a little, but ain't 'ad no luck, an' I'm

o swthat tieo b wanted something
to eat, but selfishness suggested that the profits
a( the Corner Stall were small, that he had

Jerry, was only to encourage him to come
again ; he knew him forahbadoy, -but just
here conscience put it quite plainly, whether
the lad had ever had any chance to be better.
Memory, coming to the aid of conscience, hint-
to Thomas how bitter it was to be hungry.
Ri        ..po. where will all your savings be
a hundred' year' ? and soft and earnest the
Spiriz cried to him.- Jesus died for sinners."
-"What do you want, Ratty?' said Thomas.
Won't you let me come an warm by yer
furnis?" whined the boy, called '-Ratty' be-
cause he was a Wharf Rat-that isafelow
picking up his living, generally dishonestly,
ab+ut the wharves.
Now, Rtaty," said Thomas, "I know you;
y-a want to get behind here to grab some
thin : 'nit is the word, ain't it, Ratty?  I
puts it to you square."
.W No 'ta'r" said Jerry, ut he   Led

"Hold on," said Thomas, "you're   ni

'nig'. Here's a kag," says I; "sit down,
latty; warm yer toes, and eat a meal. Thom-
as Twigg will give you a first fate A. No, I
dinner, Jerry Hockner, so walk in."
The boy seemed hardly able to believe the
word, but when Thomas. held open the little
gate that he mizht zet into the stall and cower
by one of the small furnaces, he darted to it
quickly, as if fearful of such good fortune
slipping from him.
Thomas took out of the counter the ham
bone which he had reserved for his own sup-
per, and Jerry receiving it began to gnaw it
voraciously; a cup of the black coffee was
next offered by Thomas, and then a  m oth
biscuit.
-. :ow, na, sata ..nomas, atas wnar
calls a good square meal. Pardner makes a
good biscuit sure as fate; and if there's a man
around as can beat that coffee, or a barn a

can raise such another bone, my name ain't

"I's good, it ar," said Jerry, eating.
Thomas' eyes fell on his book, and he bent
down and began to read something that had
caught his attention ; the wind had turned a
few leaves of the little volume, the wind doing
the will of that Master, without whose kindly
notice not a sparrow fails 'With care and
labor Thomas read, re-read to make it plain,
and much delighted, cried. "Hark here, Ratty,
what do vou say to this 'ere?"

Thomas read slowly, skipping the word
'fragments ' as too hard.

well, it means bits, I guess, Ratty, 'took ye

there was a secret feeling that the candy
might appease her mother, and avert the
threatened whipping, if the money for het

answ r: hep came to Thomas from that hour;

mind earnestly to the study of the word of
Go     and Mr. Allston, his faithful teacher,
was surprised and deizhted at the quicknen
ith whin he became a very tolerable reader,
and the readiness with which he appreciated
and applied the Divine Truth. The Bible
was no longer a sealed book. Thomas had no
more to skip words because they were hard or
long ; to be sure he miscalled many proper
names,: but he could re and understand.

Mr. Alston helped him, and explained to him
some, hut he had a more efficient teacher,
even the Holy Teacher, who dwells in the
hearts of the chosen.
Of Saul of Tarsus the Lord said "he is a
chosen vessel unto me: ;' so was Thomas Twigg
a chosen vessel. Saul was chosen 1for a high
and shining track, like that of some grand
planet set in heaven, but Thomas was like the
little lamp chosen to shine clearly and steadily
in an bumble place. Star and lamp alike ful-
flling His will who ruleth all, shall alike be
set-around the brightness of the. Land above.
He who penned the Chronices of Israel
and Judah, dwells not always on the names
of the mighty; he writes -- There were pot-
ters, and those that dwelt amid plants and
hedges; there they dwelt with the king for
his work."
Like these lowly servants of Solomon, who
labored in may, and in hedging and  itching,

are some men of little worldly knowledge or
station, who toil for Jesus among the outcast
and the vile, who succor paupers and criminals
and world-forgotten ones  they labor for the
King. Jesus himself is with them. Despise
not one f these little ones, for Jesus sets their
good names in the Chronicles of Jerusalem
the Gaden. The Lard will not forget the
labors of love in the lowliest places: let no one
say he can do nothing, for the Lord "increas-
eth strenzih to them tht have no might,"
and give:b more aun lant honor to those that
lack. Here is Thomas Twigg, uulearned, un-
kuu.vn, ol poor,but he goes from strength
to strength, doing the work of Jesus, an hum-
ble uncommissoned evangeist. But not yet.

The next day, as far °as business was con-

tlursan.t s were readv to : into the
country. Miss Laura had been often
to No. :2, and counld se  iiood resuhts from her
labors -in the DoddI famil  but while Mrs.
Becky Ki igan grea1Wy admired the young
lady. and always received her warmly, all re-
ligious instruction seemed to avail as little for
her as tears shed upon a tomb. Miss Laura
was not diaoraged; at the close of the after-
noon bore she left the citv, she sought the
r   T oml"nshe saiguarew.
"Thomas," shewsid,. I a     gong away,

and it will be sometime before I can. cR at
Na. 27 again. I want you to help Mrs. Dodd
all you can."
"Indeed, ma'am, I will," said Thomas.
"For yourself, Thomas, remember the word
in Revelation, ' Hold fast that thou hast, that
no man take thy crown.
A* Wont you mark it for me, ma'am," said
Thomas, eageriy taking out his Bible,  and
I'll read it every Jay.
Mliss Stuveant marked the verse, and then
ake    -  Thomas, what efforts are von mak-
in fr your partn.'s con veri.n ?"

pardner any mnire. She' o   t agi Scripter,
an so rul  of her own war it ionht do any
ood. I thought I'd leave the Lard to work."
" But, Thonas, the Lrd works hy means.
And one chief instrument ib the Scripture;
'The word of the Lord is quick and powerful
sharper than any two edged sword.' I have

been reading the Bible to Mrs. Kflianand
as yet I have seen no good results. I am now
-        about to leave town, and I want you to read
the Bible to her as nearly every day as posi
ble, and with it drop what good word the Lord
puts into your heart."
If you hav'n't done any good to her, how
can I?" said Thomas, mournfully.
Let me tell you a little story" said Miss
Laura. "A little brd. retin: on a fir-tree,
aot one of the ir-seeds in its win s. As it
flew on, the seed drlppeJ, falln: own, down,
into a narrow crack in a .zreat rock. The
winds had carried there dust and dead leaves ;
they brought vet more. The suns smote on
the rock and warmed it, rain trickled down the
crevice, the fir-seed grew.  A  long. weak,
slender shoot at first. but gaining vigor and
thriving; it e spanned. shot down aionz the
crack touzh roots, an by its strong life it tore
the stubborn rock in two, found the rich soil,

and lifted its head up to the sun, and stood for
years a landmark by the sea."
"1 take your meaning," said Thomas, bow-
ing his head ; " you've told me a parable, like
our Saiour used to tell. I'm muchly ashamed,
that after the Lord's done so much for that old
gray-headed sinner, Thomas Twigg, he'd go to
despairing of Becky Killigan, or any other poor
creature. I see the point, ma'am; if I ain't
no more than a poor, ig'rant little bird, if so
be I've lit on the Tree of Life, I can carry
good seed somewhere, and the Lord can give
it rooting, even in a rock. Thank c,  a'am,
I'l not forget that lesson very soon."
" I fear, Thomas," said Miss Laura, kindly,
that Nou hare been resting satisfied with the
good work in yourself, and have forgotten that
the first rule of the Christian life is Christ
ian labor. If you would lire, you must grow,
and you grow by activity'
"Indeed, that is the clear truth," said Thom-
as. "ni' pray over that."

went - softly out, and up to the attie, and
knocked at the door f Thomas Twi-n.

the top step, gruaninz and rocking herelf to

Thomas walked along a square or two feel

his fears, he saw son Jerry sitting with several
raged urchins on the sidewalk, playing pitch

for lying on the ground beside him; his back
was toward Mr. Twigg. Instantly, without
any warning, Thomas pounced upon the young
renegade, and while the penny Jerry had just
tossed up was yet ringing on the pavement,
Jerry himself was shaking and spinning about
in the strong hand of the indi :ant Thomas,
like a rat in the mouth of a .aiff. Jerry's
companions in evil were too much stupefied by
the swiftness and violence of Thomas Twigg's
descent to do more than sit and stare, open
mouthed. at his proceedings.
' Where is your change ?" said Thomas,
hiding his ward at arms length. Jerry point-
d to the han ul of coppers on the sidewalk,
gasping.
Thomas stooped and sorted out five pennies.

at home and ready for devotions, what an
earnest,'soulfull prayer the good man put Up
for the erring boy; that prayer, following such
a train of kindnesses, and such conscientious
coming down on sin, Jerry never forgot- he
recognized that higher power from whence all
goodness flows, and Jerry's progress was there-
after from race to grace.

"Never fear," said Thomas; "George is
going to do better now. George, here's my
~,. inconstable Tswigg. I takes you in

business long side o' 'me.  We goes and

wife; do. what Mr. Twicz sav ; see what

" TIll do it, lbut it wou': do any g.od," saidl
George.
"Well. Georzr. von iitry and Ut try ; an
we'll leave the ret to the Lord," said Thoma,
cheerily.  Let your wife keep the stand ,o

you can't. Old Polly Kepple has got a strike,

and went to the hospital, an' there's nobody
on the square selling tape, needles, shoe gs,
soap and suth like. You get a basket and a
stook, and nail together a little awning to stick
up to the fence, and you sets up in a new bud-
ness rizht lonz side of me."
"0. Mr. Twig, that's a good offer, but I
ha   t a red cnt to set up with."
WelL George," continued Thomas, with
the air of one resolved to carr through what
he nronosed, to a happy completion, -" I'll
lend you twelve dollars to start like a man,
and v4I1 pay me  ack twenty-five cents er-
err week f£r a rear out of your profits. That
w      ill be my money and a good interest on it."
"I'l get whiskey spreeing, and make no
rorit,' groaned George.
No you won't, said Thomas, "'and if pm
do, why, Il take in all your stock to sect re
myself."
g - George, do it," cried his wife.


":Il do itsMr. Twigg, and I hope you'll
hold on to me pretty tight ; hut when I do go
wrong, you know I warned you a-head of
time."
It's time we went'to bedj said Thomas,
"but before we does, just kneel down here.
and we'll Lay out our plans before the Lord,
and asksa blessin.
They all knelt, and when the pntyer was
ended, a tremulous "Amen.   came from the
old lady as she lay in her bed.
The next morning Thomas left his stall in
charge of the p nitnt ant thoruughlv subdued
Jerry, and taking Georz who had aeccompa-
nied him from N. £7.: le bout a second
hand Stotl, a Lrze basket, a goofd assortmet t
of small wares. a little frame covered witil
canvas to fasten against the fence, to shelter
him from the sun or rain. Thus he set up
George in busines a few feet from himself.
Providing the new merchant with fifty cents

in      coin to make change with,   oma
also gave him a knife, a piece of wood, and a
square of sand-paper, saying, "San gets idle
folks in mischief; so, while you're waiting for
customers, you 'whittle out picks and rings and
reels, any traps you can, and mind vou takes
my Bible and reads a chapter twice a day;
that' the Street Anehor. man, to tie yoar

(ilas, holds up all one's own meanness; that's
the Treasure house, tells all we can get for
the asking; that's the Gide Book to Glory,
,George, mind vou reads it?
Besides teaching Jerry to read and to make
lemonade, coffee and sandwiches, and sending
him ;on errands. Thomas now sent him each
niorning, to a Confectioner in a small way, to
learn how to make taffy, cornballs, peanut
candy and mint sticks. "You'll have a shop
of your own, Jerry, one day," Thomas would
say encouragingly. Thomas meant to send


Jerry to night school as soon as it opened, and
to find some way of learning to write and
cipher himself. Suddenly it occurred to him
that George Dodd could be their private in-
structor in these arts, and forthwith they
began at once.
Thomas faithfully kept George in his sight,
going to and fro between LUnin Square and
No. 27. How often -George strove to hldt,
into some groger. and just as often Thomas
dragged him along hy main strenzti   At
times, when the thirst was furious, patient
Thomas would furnish a pail full of coffee, and
lock the demented Gegorge ito his own private
attic, while himself slept on the entry floor.
Georze's wife blessed Thomas, and took what
courage she could, though her maimed, miser-
able child was a sad sight to a mother.
Often on Union Square such scenes as this
were enacted.
"What ails you, George1? You look like
running away ; what are you uneasy after?"

I

"Oh, whiskey, Thomas,
just one taste, or I'll die.
don't hold me; I'll knock,

Imuss nave t ;
MI-
'm going for it,
you down if you

I m the tougher man, George, and you'l
go down first. Come on -Eth me."
"I'm going after whiskevy if it kills"me.
"Come along," said Thomas, seizing the
arm of George. and taking a cup as they
passed the stall, he led him to the hydrant
"Have a drink, George?"
Noft water, whiker..
Drink, I tell vou.'
I can't. I hate water. Im raging thirsty
Thomas tilled the cup, and taking George s
hand, and feehig his forehead said "Yon ain't
overly hot, water won't hurt you, drink," and
he pushed the cup to George's lips-George
drank.
"Another;" that went too.
"I've had enough," said George.


"Drink more," said Thomas, the inexorable.
George was growing meeker, he denied the
Cup again.
Another, and you'll be like a lamb," said
Thomas.
Im chock full,"' said Georze, yet took the
"fRere's more." said Thomas.
"0, I'll burst," zroaned Georze-
Do you want whiskey now ? " asked DK-
tor Twigg.
No, nor nothminz -ese to drink. I'm ful
to the teeth."
Thus azain and again did Tihomas conquter
George's toe. " For it stands to reason." said
Thomas. "-that George won't crave whisrkey
when he's full of water.
Never did Thomas' faithful watching fail or
grow weary, and yet that Evil One who was
playing with IhiM for the stake of this so u
sometimes very nearly snatched away tie

-      co a   san..          18
prize. As for instance, whea one day, one
of George's bad days it was, as they came
home arm in arm, Thomas stopped to help a
child that had fallen down, and George seizing
the brlrortUnity bolted down Jug Alley, and
into a dram shop; at once Thomas was after
lim, and neither too soo  ntr too late, he
gra-pedi him just as the reeking glass was at
 in site of the struggles of the
:ntrzuated Gerge;, and the oaths and exposta-
atis of the rumsellers and his hangers on,
ise iragged him to a piaee of saiety.
I Confess  "said ThoImas to Mrs. Kiligan,
that ennig " that tile ncae  George do look

I wouldn't worrit myself about the rap-
scailion." said Mr1. KillcGan ; "you ain't his

a shaking his head. -but the Lord made it

Miss Stuyvesant came back, and was soon at
the Corner Stall, and No. Q7. Little Mary at
once gave her friend Maggie suftient clothing
to go to school looking decent, and promised
Mrs. Killigan a trifle a week for looking in on
the old woman and the baby now ad then."
"-How are you, Mrs. Killigan?" asked
Laura.
"Och, bonney, I'm the same woman I was
bast spring,' was th" reply.
"1 hoped you would be a new woman by
this time "said Miss Laura.  I prayed the
Lord to ehanze yon.
" VWel, He ain't " said the obstinate Mrs.
Killigan.
"Then I must pray harder," said Miss Law.
ra, calmly.
"Indeed, miss, I hope you had a pleaMsnt
time the summer ; you desarve it," said Mrs-.
Xilligan, touched.

Tan    you, said Miss Lamr, i've en-

The case of Jerry greatly dighted Miss
Laura and Mr. Allston, and they at once took
great interest in Geurze. Mrs. Stuyvesant
and Mary promised to patronize his basket, and
gtve him a Bible and Hymn Book, and made
him promise to go to church with his wife.
The old lady revived a httle, as things grew
better, and spoke less dolefully of 'Pappy
The rush down Jug    Alley after George,
stirred Thomnas' heart with pity for the wretch-.
ed inhabitants of that quarter. He saw them
traded, miserable and friendless, and he
nged.,to earrv 'h  igh of God's word to ii.
muine their darkness, and to tell them of the
Friend of sinners.  As Mrs. Kiligan had
grown quite restive under what she appeared
to consider the infiction o hearing the Bible

into the Alley, after Sanday school, and taking
possession of the door-step, read and talk, and
nay-be pray with whuver would listen to
him. Once, twice, Thomas did this, several
women, some half-grown children, and a man
or two were his auditors, lis:tning more from
curiosity than any better moiwe.
But all unconseiou lv Thomas hal fierce
enemies in Jug Alicy.    They called him
" Methodist     Parson,  and many other
names, and spoke to each thiler of - t witing
his neck,"  c racking is head," and -brain-
ing       - him. That Thomas was tryng to rescue
George frgma bondage tz whiskey was anp Un-
pardotia~e uJmnee; the Alley had its code
of laws, and its tut-ive Slave Law against all
helping the bandsmen of whiskey to treedomn.

"Thank the Lord you're here. Jerry, my

"Oh, o    &amp;' blubbered Jerry, "we're in

amt noboy to mind the st:alL nor Mr. Dodd."

chapter, and then both knelt while the worthy
man prayed ; but it came to pass that Thomas
was much more exercise.I about other people
than about himself. and his supplications were
chiefly for forgiveness for McClure &amp; Co., and
for protection for Geory  Dodd. Jerry rose
from his knees quite dissatisfied, and began to
complain in this fashion
"say you paint hardly said one word 'bout
Us. You spent all the time taikin' bout Paddy-
McClure an' Geor-re Dodd."
"Well, son Jerry, don't you care for
them"..
"   1es       care more for us.   Why
didn't you tell the Lord what sort of fis we d

"Wtat's the use of prayin' then?" says
Jerry.
"Because, son Jerry, it's the Lord's ap-
pointed means of getting blessin's."
- Ten," says Jerry, briskly, "why don't
yon axen what Von wants?
" Well, Jerry," said Thomas, "I'm sorry

wiLl be better to us nor all our fears, and that

and his spectacles had been destroyed the day

turned again the captivity of Job, when he
prayed for his friends.t  There, don't that hit

words, Jerry, the Lord's guing to bring light
out of darkness for us, or I'm  mucdy mis-

The hour for the appearance in court of
Thomas Twig; and Jerry Ilockney, charged
with assault and battery, and rioting, speedily
arrived.
The two had washed as well as they could,
and combed their heads with Thouas' wooden
pocket comb, but despite this care they had
certainly  a very  disreptable appearance.

at his unseemly appearance. Mr. Allton pro.
cured a hack and took him back to No. 27.
Mrs. Kileigan, George and Mrs. Dodd had
gune to business, but Thoai  aon Succeeded
in making himself and Jerry coitrtable with
bath, Itod and clean clothes. Mr. Ailston
bought a lotion for their wounds and bruises,
and then went home promuiwiwg them a visi--
from Miss Stuyvesant.
The misrtunes of Thomas TwXi    worked
for the uphuildin: of the strength of George
Dodd ; he wa: of leading strznzs. he could
go after whiskey if le would, but all at once
he was resolute against it. That king whiskey;
should make a bea t f Gieorze was one thing,
but that it shuuhl make a martyr ot Thomafl
Twigg was quite anther. Now that Thomas
was in trouble, Gere woUld not make mat-
ters worse by proving recreant himself.
In a few days Thomas and Jerry were back

at their business. Thomas had replaced their
Sunday coats, and Becky Killigan was busy
baking for the stall, and making new shirts to
supply the ones destroyed by Jug Alley.
The matter of the uproar in the Alley had
not been allowed to drop, some attention bad
been turned to the place, and to the perform-
anees of its denizens; and the result was that
Paddy McClure and his two most sigorons
supporter; were arrested and sentenced each
to s months in the penitentiary, the McClure
r    rv was tiloed, rent xva duei. and the
Clure taily were turned into the street,
The 5ther families were quite destitute. Pad

over the fallen - no, he went to help the helip

the other women, happily relieved of their
drunken husbands, and having finished hii
wOrk for them, by asking Miss Stuyvesant to
k after them a little, he slept that night
with a quiet heart.
Good deeds as these did not go unrewarded.
Jug Alley was amazed at this new method

the light had coe  ut of the darkness
But for other than Thomas, light came out
of darkness. Becky Killigan was one of those
in "gross darkness   upon whom   light did

going on, Thomas left the stall for several
hours each day with Jerry, while he scoured
Jug Alley. explaining to the residents the
intents of the new inission, getting recruits
for night school, Sunday School and preach-
ment. He went with his heart full of love,-
his pockets fall of little pictures and biscuits,
and winning the hearts of little ones by his
small zifts, and of grown foLks by his simple,
hearty speech. he .got a good many to promise
to attend to his various neetinzs. While go-
ing about in this way, be gained the appellation
of ' Daddy Twigg" from the children of the
unfortunate quarter upon which he had had
compassion.

CHAPTER VHI.

THE OFFENCE OF THE CROSS.

S the winter advanced, so advanced
thre prosp*eritv of enmrchi services,
Sunday school and evening school, in
Jug Alley. Thomas had become so interested
in his work among 5s humble friends, and
found he could do them so much goods that he
spent from  four o'clock to sx. every day
among them.
During these hours he left the stall in charge
ot Jerry, and Jerry, virtually in charge of
Dodd, who, sitting under the same little roof
with Thoms nnrerafltile ventures, gave an
eye to all that was ging on. George was
1no

getting quite steady; he could go about the
streets alone, and though he might not yet he
able to resist the fumes of a glass of his favor-
ite poison, if held under his nose, was yet es-
tablished sufficiently in good purposes to avoid
temptation. Old. Mrs. Dodd was flourishing
in clean caps and dreses, and spent her time
in talking cheerfully of the sayings and doings
of her deceased husband, anw  in ftebly media
taking on what Scripture was read to her by
ThomGa and George. Under the vigorous ad-
ministrati-u of the younger Mrs. Dodd, the
Oy ster Stall by the wharf was quite decent
and  uccessul, and the nearest policeman had
ceased to feel uneasy about it.
But now we must put on record a very
eaISant circumstance about friend Twigg.
From the day he began to give, and actively
labor for the Master, affairs of business at the
Corner Stall took, what is called, "a start"
Trade increased, profits increased, and while

Thomas provided for himself as before, and
took care of Jerry, and gave away as the Lord
prospered himhe vet laid hy as much as ever,
the more he gave the more he got. He fre-
quently spoke of this with surprise to Becky
and George, and in his ow   o odd fashion of
counting fingers and strokes, and making on
his slate scrawvr figures lake the tracks of a
drunken spider. he went over his accounts
of income and outlay, ever with the same
result.
One dat however, sitting in his stall reading
his Bible, while George, in his own corner was
carving some chess men, Thomas cried out,
there, now. George, it's all as clear as a
streak of daylight; give us an ear man, while
I deal out what I've been turning over to in
my reference Bible:  He that giveth unto the
poor shall not lack.' He that hath pity on
the poor lendeth unto the Lord: and that
which he hath given will he pay him again.'

I

Do you take the sense of those verses, George?
t He that soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully.' Don't that make all pain to
yon, George? I'll mention it to pardner this
evening. Why, man, it's the Lord's appointed
way of doing business; we give and it's like
dropping seed into ploughed ground, we get
a crop like we sowed."
So also Thomnas explaned his new light to
Becky, and true to the minzlinz of old leaven
and new, .  replied. A Arrah, Thomas. but

"And what can I do ?" asked Becky Killi.

Killigan, not interfering with any other labor-
er, went abou: that helpless alley too; and
while the little untortunates there called our
pie-man    Daddyr Twizz" they called her
Mammy Killigan." She did a good work,
and the Lord was good enough to let her seed
time and grape gathering touch each other in

some cases, that she might be thereby encour-
aged, yet the "offence of the cross" has not
ceased, and under gross ingratitude, under
bitter revilings, under such personal asntdts
as stones and mud and gutter water cast upon
her Becky felt her Irish choler rise betimes,
and was sorely tempted. to use her brawny
arms for other ends than the performing of
her legitimate duties. Neverthe less Becky
was helped not to render raiingfordrailing,
no'r to commii~ assault and battery on any body,
ad       grace her profeion, and Thomas, at
home, made it plain to her that if she was not
willing tu bear this cross of eontumei  after
Christ, she was not worthy to be his disciple.
I ain'tnater that Satan could see you
fightin' his kingdom  without his setin' in and

than kick a little mud and some bad names

Those who  ppose evil are uluualV for d
to suffer persecution from that ev2: the offence
of the cross never ceases. The were those
among Georze Dodd's olden companions who
took high exCejtion to hi separating han;el

ever they saw him they followed him witi

yet as he knew they were used as reproaches
they disturbed him greatly. They called him

under Thomas's authority, or "tied to the
apron strings of the old women." They of-

shows and -.rat fights. "
One lay two of them met George going

petticoat and a dirty, torn sack ; her hair, un-
mbed   and rough, hung down     over her
shoulders, and about her purple throat was
loosely tied a red cotton handkerchief; she
looked the very genius of the wretched place;
yet from this poor helpless creature came a
voice of warning. She turned her blood shot
eyes. gkeamng yet with the frequent fires of
the drunkard's delirium, upon George, and
cried in a harsh, shrill voice,
If I were as near being' saved as you are,
George Dodd, I wouldn't go back to ruin  If
I stood where I could be somebody fit and
decent, I wouldn't go down to the ditches

Sn many and such honest words had never
been heard from drunken Jane before; they

roused what slumberng honor andg       s
was in George Dodd; he looked about him on
the haggard and bloated faces, the trembling,
ragged figures, the bkared eyes of those who
crowded about him; a viIson of their beggary,
their misery, their wild riots and their horrible
tteazies rose before him, and putrins down the
untouched glass and clearing his way between
his erowdin: tempters, he dashed out of the
do r and homeward through the' keen, cold
winds, and the rising winter storm.
It was a day or two after that he told the
ta- 0f this escape to Thomas, giving Jane
h r due. Thomas had sometimes spoken to
Jane, and. tried to influence her, but without
any success but -this story of George's gave
him hope for the woman; he resolved to seek
her out and try and reform her. He sought
her for two days, and ound her at last - but

Paddy McClure came from the six month's
confinement, to which he had been condemned-
and walked slowly down Jug Alley; he had
not a penny in his pockets, and wits perfect
sober, preferring to get home and get drunk
on his own premises. He was cleaner, stouter,
straighter, than when arrested for assult and
battery; his time in the penitentiary set apar
from rows, and bound to honest labor had done
him good. When Lie came to what he con-
sidered his own door he found it fastened, and
the windows were losed with strong shutters

Paddy McClure, not yet burnt out b whiskey,
He had hitherto had some den be called home,
and clung to it as the wild beast to his lair.
He leaned against the side of the house a
minute, looked about for a place to get a glass
of liquor, but seeing none hut that kept by his
olden foe and rival, concluded to go to another
street for whiskey, and, stumbling blindly
ang, dazed by the blow he had received, he
plunged against a woman carrying a bundle
of work, a thin, half-satternlr woman, the
same who had used his sign for fuel, and to
whom, when she was sick. Thomas had sent
Mrs. Killigan-
"  , Paddy, are you out?" she said; "have
you seen the old woman?"
"How should I ?! asked McClure.
" Mebby you'd better not, she's better off
without you. Jane's dead, bin drowned, and-
where's them fellows got sent up with you?"W
-"Bill's sick, in 'ospital, 'and Dick's gone
tramping."

"Glad of it," said the woman.     Bil's
wife's taking in clothes to wash, and doiW'
pretty good at it, and Dick' woman is hired
out to a restaurant; her children is put out to
places. Im doin' pretty good myself-so's
your old woman."
".MV woman ain't she dead ? "
No, in course not, why should she die?
She's living nice. and your big girl is out to
place  and the boys goes to school, and the
babv' grown like gas."
-Your chaffing," said McClure.
aNo I ain't : she was turned into the street,
the hoys was sik, she hadn't a cent, they were
crying with cold, and Daddy Twigg got 'em a
room and work, and helped 'em amazing. It's
all along of him them other women got above
board, and he did all for me or I'd be dead
afore now.

"I don't believe a word of it."
"Go see," said the woman, tartly; "round
in the street, No. 29, third floor, back; there,
now, if them ain't your folks, and helped on
just as I said, pitch me into the river."
She walked on with her bunile, and M-

knock, but recogcnizing . his wife's voie, open I
the door ; tor a moment le was unnotice. iHe
had a full view of the room; it was comforta-

McClure moved ; the group at the table looked
up, the little boys gave a cry of dismay and
fled behind the bed. The mother rose ; she
felt somewhat like welcoming her husband. but
she glanced about her comfortable room, and
felt as if he brought desolation, then she checked
te feeling and went to meet him. McClure

Then there came a knock at the door, and
on opening it, in came Thomas Twig himself;
when he saw Paddy McClure, he walked up,
holding out his hand, looking him squarely in
the eye, and saving.
"I'm glad to see vou home, my man.

HOLDING ON.

H AT was a grand temperance meeting
in Jug Alley ;zrand not so much from
force of numbers or from the power
and intellizence of those who gathered to it,
" from the fact of information that permitted
it to be there at al. It was a grand thing
atc the o1 whiskey shop was turned into a

Old Mrs. Dodd was growv4ing weaker, but as
her bodily strev nh decayed i+r mind brigh-
ened up a lttie. She said one day to her
daughter-it-law, ' WVli, Bridgtt, Pappy D  d
told me to hold on to the promises, and 1ve
been holding ou a fast as I could, and now

and I tink  ve come, and he says, take

She asked her son one day, "George, have
yon put your name to paper not to tech no
more whiskey?"
" Yes, mother," he replied.
."Well, now, George, just bold on to that;
hold on to it and I won't feel onpicasant when
I gets to glory and meets Pappy Dodd. I'll

Mrs. Killigan looked after Mrs. George
DtJP' feeble ones, the old lady of eighty, and
the young baby of two, but after a while the
old lady  otdso helpless that she needed
constant -care, and Mrs. Dodd said she must
stay at home and take care of her, but what
would become of the stand on the wharf
which was half their living. Thomas offered
to sell George's small wares at the Corner
Stall that George might go to the wharf.

said the wife, uneasy ; but here, with a sudden
gam of intelligence, the old woman spoke,
"Let him go, Bridget: I want to know if he
can stand temptation and ain't a-going to fall
away any more, so's I can tell Papp  Dodd,

"True for him; could you fnd me that

for Mrs. TohAs -a ;_- was very proud
of her new accomplishment of reading.
"I don't know where it i    said Jerry,
after a little search,** bat I'l tell you what
more he said: One never loses by taking the
Lord at his word;' and he bid me keep it n

Meanwhile, active as ever, a little more
wrikled of face, and grided fA hair, Thomas
Twigg stood in the Corner Stall. It was
about six &amp;ch=ek. and newsboys and shoe-
blacks were gathering about him, eager for
their  p     moA of them having eaten-nth-
ing since breakfast. There were those called

AToes," "Herald,"    " World," "Tr,"
not the same boys as three years ago, for moat
of those had outgrown the business, and found
other work to do.
Of all these hors Thomas was the adviser
and confidential friend. " Times c onfided to
him how much he had put in the Saving's
Bank, and "Herald" asked his advice about
getting a home in the country 'Tiser " was
roundly reprovea for selling apers on SUna,
and several Scripters, suitable to the occasion,
were dealt out to him.
Here was a boot-black whose sick mother
was inquired after. here another with a little
humpbacked sister, &amp; deftrmity, alas. fearfully
common among New York poor, and to this
little unfortunate Thomas sent one of his best
cakes, a trifling gift, to be sure, but what a
sunny ray in that poor little one's existence,

business, Thomas heartily recomrnendA the

to take him there as soon as Jerry got back.
Thus daily was Thomas, sowing good seed
beside all waters; he found even m that hum-
ble sail, on the corner of Union Square, a
wide field of labor, and plenty to occupy heart
and.hand a ine commentary his active, useful
life on those who have a nothing to do.
On a hot simmer eveig, Thomas went
home, after a iong day of 'tandm in the -stall,
and two hours of labor through t   stifling
tenant houses of Jug Alley. A  he came to
No. Q7, he saw McCluie, and hs wile, sattm
on the door-sill of No. 29, and stopped to talk
with them.
where are the ehilder?" he aed.
"Thevre un' for a walk, por thigs,

Thank you, kindly," said Mrs. McClure.-
Il go next week and look out a place,"
said the husband, decidedly.
Thomas went up stairs, weary but encour-
aged, and humming a hymn tune; as he went
through the lower entry, he saw Mrs. Dodd
in her room, rocking her little sick boy to
sleep, Maggie, making patchwork, at the win-
dow, and in the opposite room.. a snug, tidy
shop, George waiting on two otthree custom-
er. who had come for sixpences worth of
soap, salt, matches, or tea. Up stairs, and in
her room, door and windows open, sat Mrs.
Killigan.
"Did ye leave the boy to lock up?" she
asked.
Yes,"' said Thomas.  I thought he would
do well enough alone."
And does he lock up safe. and bring things
home in gooA order?"
Yes, pardner, hes very trusty."

"That's no excuse for nittinz work," said
Thomas Twigg. * When it pleased the Lord
to convert my sea., I was bound out to
him body and soul, to b his servant and do
his work. He  never given me back My in-

will. Indeed, pardner, don't the Lord justly

his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.'

old man; you'll miss it, see if vou don't."
SI see I must deal you out another Scrip-

again, and holding it to the ight, he read,
